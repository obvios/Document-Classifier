Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton. There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym. He was Spider Kelly's star pupil. Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds. But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really very fast. He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened. This increased Cohn's distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose. In his last year at Princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his class who remembered him. They did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion. I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young child, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly. Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had become of him. Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the oldest. At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious. No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton. He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter. He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him. He was married five years, had three children, lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter. As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock. The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast. In California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of the Arts. The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and finished in Provincetown, Massachusetts. By that time Cohn, who had been regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the sole editor. It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority of editing. He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he had to give it up. By that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine. She was very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand. Also he was sure that he loved her. When this lady saw that the magazine was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was still something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where Cohn could write. They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated, and stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend. The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the second year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her. During this time Robert's mother had settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month. During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at another woman. He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living in Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered writing. He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the critics later called it, although it was a very poor novel. He read many books, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium. I first became aware of his lady's attitude toward him one night after the three of us had dined together. We had dined at l'Avenue's and afterward went to the CafÃ© de Versailles for coffee. We had several fines after the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip. He wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk. I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace. "I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town," I said. Somebody kicked me under the table. I thought it was accidental and went on: "She's been there two years and knows everything there is to know about the town. She's a swell girl." I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert's lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening. "Hell," I said, "why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to the Ardennes." Cohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said good-night and went out. Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner with me. "For God's sake," he said, "why did you say that about that girl in Strasbourg for? Didn't you see Frances?" "No, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg what the hell is it to Frances?" "It doesn't make any difference. Any girl. I couldn't go, that would be all." "Don't be silly." "You don't know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn't you see the way she looked?" "Oh, well," I said, "let's go to Senlis." "Don't get sore." "I'm not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerf and take a hike in the woods and come home." "Good, that will be fine." "Well, I'll see you to-morrow at the courts," I said. "Good-night, Jake," he said, and started back to the cafÃ©. "You forgot to get your paper," I said. "That's so." He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. "You are not sore, are you, Jake?" He turned with the paper in his hand. "No, why should I be?" "See you at tennis," he said. I watched him walk back to the cafÃ© holding his paper. I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life. CHAPTER 2 That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was accepted by a fairly good publisher. His going made an awful row I heard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because several women were nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quite changed. He was more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he was not so simple, and he was not so nice. The publishers had praised his novel pretty highly and it rather went to his head. Then several women had put themselves out to be nice to him, and his horizons had all shifted. For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond Frances. I am sure he had never been in love in his life. He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college, and Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not been everything to his first wife. He was not in love yet but he realized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact of a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply a divine miracle. This changed him so that he was not so pleasant to have around. Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in some rather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had held cards and won several hundred dollars. It made him rather vain of his bridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always make a living at bridge if he were ever forced to. Then there was another thing. He had been reading W. H. Hudson. That sounds like an innocent occupation, but Cohn had read and reread "The Purple Land." "The Purple Land" is a very sinister book if read too late in life. It recounts splendid imaginary amorous adventures of a perfect English gentleman in an intensely romantic land, the scenery of which is very well described. For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-book to what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the same age to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent, equipped with a complete set of the more practical Alger books. Cohn, I believe, took every word of "The Purple Land" as literally as though it had been an R. G. Dun report. You understand me, he made some reservations, but on the whole the book to him was sound. It was all that was needed to set him off. I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until one day he came into my office. "Hello, Robert," I said. "Did you come in to cheer me up?" "Would you like to go to South America, Jake?" he asked. "No." "Why not?" "I don't know. I never wanted to go. Too expensive. You can see all the South Americans you want in Paris anyway." "They're not the real South Americans." "They look awfully real to me." I had a boat train to catch with a week's mail stories, and only half of them written. "Do you know any dirt?" I asked. "No." "None of your exalted connections getting divorces?" "No; listen, Jake. If I handled both our expenses, would you go to South America with me?" "Why me?" "You can talk Spanish. And it would be more fun with two of us." "No," I said, "I like this town and I go to Spain in the summer-time." "All my life I've wanted to go on a trip like that," Cohn said. He sat down. "I'll be too old before I can ever do it." "Don't be a fool," I said. "You can go anywhere you want. You've got plenty of money." "I know. But I can't get started." "Cheer up," I said. "All countries look just like the moving pictures." But I felt sorry for him. He had it badly. "I can't stand it to think my life is going so fast and I'm not really living it." "Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters." "I'm not interested in bull-fighters. That's an abnormal life. I want to go back in the country in South America. We could have a great trip." "Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?" "No, I wouldn't like that." "I'd go there with you." "No; that doesn't interest me." "That's because you never read a book about it. Go on and read a book all full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses." "I want to go to South America." He had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak. "Come on down-stairs and have a drink." "Aren't you working?" "No," I said. We went down the stairs to the cafÃ© on the ground floor. I had discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends. Once you had a drink all you had to say was: "Well, I've got to get back and get off some cables," and it was done. It is very important to discover graceful exits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important part of the ethics that you should never seem to be working. Anyway, we went down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda. Cohn looked at the bottles in bins around the wall. "This is a good place," he said. "There's a lot of liquor," I agreed. "Listen, Jake," he leaned forward on the bar. "Don't you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you're not taking advantage of it? Do you realize you've lived nearly half the time you have to live already?" "Yes, every once in a while." "Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we'll be dead?" "What the hell, Robert," I said. "What the hell." "I'm serious." "It's one thing I don't worry about," I said. "You ought to." "I've had plenty to worry about one time or other. I'm through worrying." "Well, I want to go to South America." "Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn't make any difference. I've tried all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There's nothing to that." "But you've never been to South America." "South America hell! If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don't you start living your life in Paris?" "I'm sick of Paris, and I'm sick of the Quarter." "Stay away from the Quarter. Cruise around by yourself and see what happens to you." "Nothing happens to me. I walked alone all one night and nothing happened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my papers." "Wasn't the town nice at night?" "I don't care for Paris." So there you were. I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you could do anything about, because right away you ran up against the two stubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris. He got the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a book too. "Well," I said, "I've got to go up-stairs and get off some cables." "Do you really have to go?" "Yes, I've got to get these cables off." "Do you mind if I come up and sit around the office?" "No, come on up." He sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor and Publisher and I worked hard for two hours. Then I sorted out the carbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila envelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare. I went out into the other room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the big chair. He was asleep with his head on his arms. I did not like to wake him up, but I wanted to lock the office and shove off. I put my hand on his shoulder. He shook his head. "I can't do it," he said, and put his head deeper into his arms. "I can't do it. Nothing will make me do it." "Robert," I said, and shook him by the shoulder. He looked up. He smiled and blinked. "Did I talk out loud just then?" "Something. But it wasn't clear." "God, what a rotten dream!" "Did the typewriter put you to sleep?" "Guess so. I didn't sleep all last night." "What was the matter?" "Talking," he said. I could picture it. I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom scenes of my friends. We went out to the CafÃ© Napolitain to have an apÃ©ritif and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard. CHAPTER 3 It was a warm spring night and I sat at a table on the terrace of the Napolitain after Robert had gone, watching it get dark and the electric signs come on, and the red and green stop-and-go traffic-signal, and the crowd going by, and the horse-cabs clippety-clopping along at the edge of the solid taxi traffic, and the poules going by, singly and in pairs, looking for the evening meal. I watched a good-looking girl walk past the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her, and watched another, and then saw the first one coming back again. She went by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat down at the table. The waiter came up. "Well, what will you drink?" I asked. "Pernod." "That's not good for little girls." "Little girl yourself. Dites garÃ§on, un pernod." "A pernod for me, too." "What's the matter?" she asked. "Going on a party?" "Sure. Aren't you?" "I don't know. You never know in this town." "Don't you like Paris?" "No." "Why don't you go somewhere else?" "Isn't anywhere else." "You're happy, all right." "Happy, hell!" Pernod is greenish imitation absinthe. When you add water it turns milky. It tastes like licorice and it has a good uplift, but it drops you just as far. We sat and drank it, and the girl looked sullen. "Well," I said, "are you going to buy me a dinner?" She grinned and I saw why she made a point of not laughing. With her mouth closed she was a rather pretty girl. I paid for the saucers and we walked out to the street. I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up at the curb. Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling fiacre we moved up the Avenue de l'OpÃ©ra, passed the locked doors of the shops, their windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted. The cab passed the New York Herald bureau with the window full of clocks. "What are all the clocks for?" she asked. "They show the hour all over America." "Don't kid me." We turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides, through the traffic of the Rue de Rivoli, and through a dark gate into the Tuileries. She cuddled against me and I put my arm around her. She looked up to be kissed. She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away. "Never mind." "What's the matter? You sick?" "Yes." "Everybody's sick. I'm sick, too." We came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine and then turned up the Rue des Saints PÃ¨res. "You oughtn't to drink pernod if you're sick." "You neither." "It doesn't make any difference with me. It doesn't make any difference with a woman." "What are you called?" "Georgette. How are you called?" "Jacob." "That's a Flemish name." "American too." "You're not Flamand?" "No, American." "Good, I detest Flamands." By this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the cocher to stop. We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place. "This is no great thing of a restaurant." "No," I said. "Maybe you would rather go to Foyot's. Why don't you keep the cab and go on?" I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be nice to eat with some one. It was a long time since I had dined with a poule, and I had forgotten how dull it could be. We went into the restaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room. Georgette cheered up a little under the food. "It isn't bad here," she said. "It isn't chic, but the food is all right." "Better than you eat in LiÃ¨ge." "Brussels, you mean." We had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke. She smiled and showed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses. "You're not a bad type," she said. "It's a shame you're sick. We get on well. What's the matter with you, anyway?" "I got hurt in the war," I said. "Oh, that dirty war." We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been better avoided. I was bored enough. Just then from the other room some one called: "Barnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!" "It's a friend calling me," I explained, and went out. There was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne, Mrs. Braddocks, several people I did not know. "You're coming to the dance, aren't you?" Braddocks asked. "What dance?" "Why, the dancings. Don't you know we've revived them?" Mrs. Braddocks put in. "You must come, Jake. We're all going," Frances said from the end of the table. She was tall and had a smile. "Of course, he's coming," Braddocks said. "Come in and have coffee with us, Barnes." "Right." "And bring your friend," said Mrs. Braddocks laughing. She was a Canadian and had all their easy social graces. "Thanks, we'll be in," I said. I went back to the small room. "Who are your friends?" Georgette asked. "Writers and artists." "There are lots of those on this side of the river." "Too many." "I think so. Still, some of them make money." "Oh, yes." We finished the meal and the wine. "Come on," I said. "We're going to have coffee with the others." Georgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in the little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lipstick, and straightened her hat. "Good," she said. We went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at his table stood up. "I wish to present my fiancÃ©e, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc," I said. Georgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round. "Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?" Mrs. Braddocks asked. "Connais pas," Georgette answered. "But you have the same name," Mrs. Braddocks insisted cordially. "No," said Georgette. "Not at all. My name is Hobin." "But Mr. Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc. Surely he did," insisted Mrs. Braddocks, who in the excitement of talking French was liable to have no idea what she was saying. "He's a fool," Georgette said. "Oh, it was a joke, then," Mrs. Braddocks said. "Yes," said Georgette. "To laugh at." "Did you hear that, Henry?" Mrs. Braddocks called down the table to Braddocks. "Mr. Barnes introduced his fiancÃ©e as Mademoiselle Leblanc, and her name is actually Hobin." "Of course, darling. Mademoiselle Hobin, I've known her for a very long time." "Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin," Frances Clyne called, speaking French very rapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its coming out really French. "Have you been in Paris long? Do you like it here? You love Paris, do you not?" "Who's she?" Georgette turned to me. "Do I have to talk to her?" She turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her head poised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again. "No, I don't like Paris. It's expensive and dirty." "Really? I find it so extraordinarily clean. One of the cleanest cities in all Europe." "I find it dirty." "How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long." "I've been here long enough." "But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that." Georgette turned to me. "You have nice friends." Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but the coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we all went out and started for Braddocks's dancing-club. The dancing-club was a bal musette in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte GeneviÃ¨ve. Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter danced there. One night a week it was the dancing-club. On Monday nights it was closed. When we arrived it was quite empty, except for a policeman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of the zinc bar, and the proprietor himself. The daughter of the house came downstairs as we went in. There were long benches, and tables ran across the room, and at the far end a dancing-floor. "I wish people would come earlier," Braddocks said. The daughter came up and wanted to know what we would drink. The proprietor got up on a high stool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion. He had a string of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as he played. Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor perspiring. "My God," Georgette said. "What a box to sweat in!" "It's hot." "Hot, my God!" "Take off your hat." "That's a good idea." Some one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar. It was really very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night. I drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the street. Two taxis were coming down the steep street. They both stopped in front of the Bal. A crowd of young men, some in jerseys and some in their shirt-sleeves, got out. I could see their hands and newly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door. The policeman standing by the door looked at me and smiled. They came in. As they went in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces, grimacing, gesturing, talking. With them was Brett. She looked very lovely and she was very much with them. One of them saw Georgette and said: "I do declare. There is an actual harlot. I'm going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me." The tall dark one, called Lett, said: "Don't you be rash." The wavy blond one answered: "Don't you worry, dear." And with them was Brett. I was very angry. Somehow they always made me angry. I know they are supposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering composure. Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar at the next Bal. The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to take the taste out of my mouth. When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd on the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who danced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he danced. As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to dance. She had been taken up by them. I knew then that they would all dance with her. They are like that. I sat down at a table. Cohn was sitting there. Frances was dancing. Mrs. Braddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss. He was from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist. He had some sort of an English accent. I asked him to have a drink. "Thanks so much," he said, "I've just had one." "Have another." "Thanks, I will then." We got the daughter of the house over and each had a fine Ã  l'eau. "You're from Kansas City, they tell me," he said. "Yes." "Do you find Paris amusing?" "Yes." "Really?" I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless. "For God's sake," I said, "yes. Don't you?" "Oh, how charmingly you get angry," he said. "I wish I had that faculty." I got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor. Mrs. Braddocks followed me. "Don't be cross with Robert," she said. "He's still only a child, you know." "I wasn't cross," I said. "I just thought perhaps I was going to throw up." "Your fiancÃ©e is having a great success," Mrs. Braddocks looked out on the floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one, called Lett. "Isn't she?" I said. "Rather," said Mrs. Braddocks. Cohn came up. "Come on, Jake," he said, "have a drink." We walked over to the bar. "What's the matter with you? You seem all worked up over something?" "Nothing. This whole show makes me sick is all." Brett came up to the bar. "Hello, you chaps." "Hello, Brett," I said. "Why aren't you tight?" "Never going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and soda." She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her. He looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the promised land. Cohn, of course, was much younger. But he had that look of eager, deserving expectation. Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started all that. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you missed none of it with that wool jersey. "It's a fine crowd you're with, Brett," I said. "Aren't they lovely? And you, my dear. Where did you get it?" "At the Napolitain." "And have you had a lovely evening?" "Oh, priceless," I said. Brett laughed. "It's wrong of you, Jake. It's an insult to all of us. Look at Frances there, and Jo." This for Cohn's benefit. "It's in restraint of trade," Brett said. She laughed again. "You're wonderfully sober," I said. "Yes. Aren't I? And when one's with the crowd I'm with, one can drink in such safety, too." The music started and Robert Cohn said: "Will you dance this with me, Lady Brett?" Brett smiled at him. "I've promised to dance this with Jacob," she laughed. "You've a hell of a biblical name, Jake." "How about the next?" asked Cohn. "We're going," Brett said. "We've a date up at Montmartre." Dancing, I looked over Brett's shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still watching her. "You've made a new one there," I said to her. "Don't talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now." "Oh, well," I said. "I suppose you like to add them up." "Don't talk like a fool." "You do." "Oh, well. What if I do?" "Nothing," I said. We were dancing to the accordion and some one was playing the banjo. It was hot and I felt happy. We passed close to Georgette dancing with another one of them. "What possessed you to bring her?" "I don't know, I just brought her." "You're getting damned romantic." "No, bored." "Now?" "No, not now." "Let's get out of here. She's well taken care of." "Do you want to?" "Would I ask you if I didn't want to?" We left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it on. Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her. I stopped at the bar and asked them for an envelope. The patronne found one. I took a fifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and handed it to the patronne. "If the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?" I said. "If she goes out with one of those gentlemen, will you save this for me?" "C'est entendu, Monsieur," the patronne said. "You go now? So early?" "Yes," I said. We started out the door. Cohn was still talking to Brett. She said good night and took my arm. "Good night, Cohn," I said. Outside in the street we looked for a taxi. "You're going to lose your fifty francs," Brett said. "Oh, yes." "No taxis." "We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one." "Come on and we'll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one." "You wouldn't walk across the street." "Not if I could help it." We went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi. "Well," I said, "we're out away from them." We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each other. The waiter came and said the taxi was outside. Brett pressed my hand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out. "Where should I tell him?" I asked. "Oh, tell him to drive around." I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammed the door. Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed. I got in and sat beside her. The cab started with a jerk. "Oh, darling, I've been so miserable," Brett said. CHAPTER 4 The taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into the dark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St. Etienne du Mont, went smoothly down the asphalt, passed the trees and the standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe, then turned onto the cobbles of the Rue Mouffetard. There were lighted bars and late open shops on each side of the street. We were sitting apart and we jolted close together going down the old street. Brett's hat was off. Her head was back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des Gobelins. The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracks by the light of acetylene flares. Brett's face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street was dark again and I kissed her. Our lips were tight together and then she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away as she could get. Her head was down. "Don't touch me," she said. "Please don't touch me." "What's the matter?" "I can't stand it." "Oh, Brett." "You mustn't. You must know. I can't stand it, that's all. Oh, darling, please understand!" "Don't you love me?" "Love you? I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me." "Isn't there anything we can do about it?" She was sitting up now. My arm was around her and she was leaning back against me, and we were quite calm. She was looking into my eyes with that way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw out of her own eyes. They would look on and on after every one else's eyes in the world would have stopped looking. She looked as though there were nothing on earth she would not look at like that, and really she was afraid of so many things. "And there's not a damn thing we could do," I said. "I don't know," she said. "I don't want to go through that hell again." "We'd better keep away from each other." "But, darling, I have to see you. It isn't all that you know." "No, but it always gets to be." "That's my fault. Don't we pay for all the things we do, though?" She had been looking into my eyes all the time. Her eyes had different depths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat. Now you could see all the way into them. "When I think of the hell I've put chaps through. I'm paying for it all now." "Don't talk like a fool," I said. "Besides, what happened to me is supposed to be funny. I never think about it." "Oh, no. I'll lay you don't." "Well, let's shut up about it." "I laughed about it too, myself, once." She wasn't looking at me. "A friend of my brother's came home that way from Mons. It seemed like a hell of a joke. Chaps never know anything, do they?" "No," I said. "Nobody ever knows anything." I was pretty well through with the subject. At one time or another I had probably considered it from most of its various angles, including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious for the person possessing them. "It's funny," I said. "It's very funny. And it's a lot of fun, too, to be in love." "Do you think so?" her eyes looked flat again. "I don't mean fun that way. In a way it's an enjoyable feeling." "No," she said. "I think it's hell on earth." "It's good to see each other." "No. I don't think it is." "Don't you want to?" "I have to." We were sitting now like two strangers. On the right was the Parc Montsouris. The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and where you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark. The driver leaned his head around. "Where do you want to go?" I asked. Brett turned her head away. "Oh, go to the Select." "CafÃ© Select," I told the driver. "Boulevard Montparnasse." We drove straight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards the passing Montrouge trams. Brett looked straight ahead. On the Boulevard Raspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: "Would you mind very much if I asked you to do something?" "Don't be silly." "Kiss me just once more before we get there." When the taxi stopped I got out and paid. Brett came out putting on her hat. She gave me her hand as she stepped down. Her hand was shaky. "I say, do I look too much of a mess?" She pulled her man's felt hat down and started in for the bar. Inside, against the bar and at tables, were most of the crowd who a been at the dance. "Hello, you chaps," Brett said. "I'm going to have a drink." "Oh, Brett! Brett!" the little Greek portrait-painter, who called himself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her. "I got something fine to tell you." "Hello, Zizi," Brett said. "I want you to meet a friend," Zizi said. A fat man came up. "Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley." "How do you do?" said Brett. "Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?" asked Count Mippipopolous, who wore an elk's tooth on his watch-chain. "Rather," said Brett. "Paris is a fine town all right," said the count. "But I guess you have pretty big doings yourself over in London." "Oh, yes," said Brett. "Enormous." Braddocks called to me from a table. "Barnes," he said, "have a drink. That girl of yours got in a frightful row." "What about?" "Something the patronne's daughter said. A corking row. She was rather splendid, you know. Showed her yellow card and demanded the patronne's daughter's too. I say it was a row." "What finally happened?" "Oh, some one took her home. Not a bad-looking girl. Wonderful command of the idiom. Do stay and have a drink." "No," I said. "I must shove off. Seen Cohn?" "He went home with Frances," Mrs. Braddock put in. "Poor chap, he looks awfully down," Braddocks said. "I dare say he is," said Mrs. Braddocks. "I have to shove off," I said. "Good night." I said good night to Brett at the bar. The count was buying champagne. "Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?" he asked. "No. Thanks awfully. I have to go." "Really going?" Brett asked. "Yes," I said. "I've got a rotten headache." "I'll see you to-morrow?" "Come in at the office." "Hardly." "Well, where will I see you?" "Anywhere around five o'clock." "Make it the other side of town then." "Good. I'll be at the Crillon at five." "Try and be there," I said. "Don't worry," Brett said. "I've never let you down, have I?" "Heard from Mike?" "Letter to-day." "Good night, sir," said the count. I went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St. Michel, passed the tables of the Rotonde, still crowded, looked across the street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of the pavement. Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it was and went on. I wanted to get home. The Boulevard Montparnasse was deserted. Lavigne's was closed tight, and they were stacking the tables outside the Closerie des Lilas. I passed Ney's statue standing among the new-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light. There was a faded purple wreath leaning against the base. I stopped and read the inscription: from the Bonapartist Groups, some date; I forget. He looked very fine, Marshal Ney in his top-boots, gesturing with his sword among the green new horse-chestnut leaves. My flat was just across the street, a little way down the Boulevard St. Michel. There was a light in the concierge's room and I knocked on the door and she gave me my mail. I wished her good night and went up-stairs. There were two letters and some papers. I looked at them under the gas-light in the dining-room. The letters were from the States. One was a bank statement. It showed a balance of $2432.60. I got out my check-book and deducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discovered I had a balance of $1832.60. I wrote this on the back of the statement. The other letter was a wedding announcement. Mr. and Mrs. Aloysius Kirby announce the marriage of their daughter Katherine--I knew neither the girl nor the man she was marrying. They must be circularizing the town. It was a funny name. I felt sure I could remember anybody with a name like Aloysius. It was a good Catholic name. There was a crest on the announcement. Like Zizi the Greek duke. And that count. The count was funny. Brett had a title, too. Lady Ashley. To hell with Brett. To hell with you, Lady Ashley. I lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the wide windows. The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with the windows open and undressed by the bed. Outside a night train, running on the street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets. They were noisy at night when you could not sleep. Undressing, I looked at myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed. That was a typically French way to furnish a room. Practical, too, I suppose. Of all the ways to be wounded. I suppose it was funny. I put on my pajamas and got into bed. I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their wrappers off. One was orange. The other yellow. They would both have the same news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other. Le Toril was the better paper, so I started to read it. I read it all the way through, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams. I blew out the lamp. Perhaps I would be able to sleep. My head started to work. The old grievance. Well, it was a rotten way to be wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian. In the Italian hospital we were going to form a society. It had a funny name in Italian. I wonder what became of the others, the Italians. That was in the Ospedale Maggiore in Milano, Padiglione Ponte. The next building was the Padiglione Zonda. There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it was Zonda. That was where the liaison colonel came to visit me. That was funny. That was about the first funny thing. I was all bandaged up. But they had told him about it. Then he made that wonderful speech: "You, a foreigner, an Englishman" (any foreigner was an Englishman) "have given more than your life." What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated to hang in the office. He never laughed. He was putting himself in my place, I guess. "Che mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna!" I never used to realize it, I guess. I try and play it along and just not make trouble for people. Probably I never would have had any trouble if I hadn't run into Brett when they shipped me to England. I suppose she only wanted what she couldn't have. Well, people were that way. To hell with people. The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of handling all that. Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it. I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn't keep away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it went away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I started to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I went to sleep. I woke up. There was a row going on outside. I listened and I thought I recognized a voice. I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door. The concierge was talking down-stairs. She was very angry. I heard my name and called down the stairs. "Is that you, Monsieur Barnes?" the concierge called. "Yes. It's me." "There's a species of woman here who's waked the whole street up. What kind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see you. I've told her you're asleep." Then I heard Brett's voice. Half asleep I had been sure it was Georgette. I don't know why. She could not have known my address. "Will you send her up, please?" Brett came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk. "Silly thing to do," she said. "Make an awful row. I say, you weren't asleep, were you?" "What did you think I was doing?" "Don't know. What time is it?" I looked at the clock. It was half-past four. "Had no idea what hour it was," Brett said. "I say, can a chap sit down? Don't be cross, darling. Just left the count. He brought me here." "What's he like?" I was getting brandy and soda and glasses. "Just a little," said Brett. "Don't try and make me drunk. The count? Oh, rather. He's quite one of us." "Is he a count?" "Here's how. I rather think so, you know. Deserves to be, anyhow. Knows hell's own amount about people. Don't know where he got it all. Owns a chain of sweetshops in the States." She sipped at her glass. "Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up. Told me a little about it. Damned interesting. He's one of us, though. Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell." She took another drink. "How do I buck on about all this? You don't mind, do you? He's putting up for Zizi, you know." "Is Zizi really a duke, too?" "I shouldn't wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the count." "Where did you go with him?" "Oh, everywhere. He just brought me here now. Offered me ten thousand dollars to go to Biarritz with him. How much is that in pounds?" "Around two thousand." "Lot of money. I told him I couldn't do it. He was awfully nice about it. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz." Brett laughed. "I say, you are slow on the up-take," she said. I had only sipped my brandy and soda. I took a long drink. "That's better. Very funny," Brett said. "Then he wanted me to go to Cannes with him. Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people everywhere. Quite true, too. So I asked him to bring me here." She looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised. "Don't look like that," she said. "Told him I was in love with you. True, too. Don't look like that. He was damn nice about it. Wants to drive us out to dinner to-morrow night. Like to go?" "Why not?" "I'd better go now." "Why?" "Just wanted to see you. Damned silly idea. Want to get dressed and come down? He's got the car just up the street." "The count?" "Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have breakfast in the Bois. Hampers. Got it all at Zelli's. Dozen bottles of Mumms. Tempt you?" "I have to work in the morning," I said. "I'm too far behind you now to catch up and be any fun." "Don't be an ass." "Can't do it." "Right. Send him a tender message?" "Anything. Absolutely." "Good night, darling." "Don't be sentimental." "You make me ill." We kissed good night and Brett shivered. "I'd better go," she said. "Good night, darling." "You don't have to go." "Yes." We kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the concierge muttered something behind her door. I went back up-stairs and from the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the big limousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light. She got in and it started off. I turned around. On the table was an empty glass and a glass half-full of brandy and soda. I took them both out to the kitchen and poured the half-full glass down the sink. I turned off the gas in the dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got into bed. This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about. Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing. CHAPTER 5 In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for coffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut trees in the Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the pleasant early-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock. Students went by going up to the law school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams and people going to work. I got on an S bus and rode down to the Madeleine, standing on the back platform. From the Madeleine I walked along the Boulevard des Capucines to the OpÃ©ra, and up to my office. I passed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys. I stepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl assistant manipulated the boxers. She was standing looking away, the thread in her folded hands. The man was urging two tourists to buy. Three more tourists had stopped and were watching. I walked on behind a man who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO on the sidewalk in damp letters. All along people were going to work. It felt pleasant to be going to work. I walked across the avenue and turned in to my office. Up-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and then sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning's work. At eleven o'clock I went over to the Quai d'Orsay in a taxi and went in and sat with about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece, a young Nouvelle Revue FranÃ§aise diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles, talked and answered questions for half an hour. The President of the Council was in Lyons making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back. Several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a couple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the answers. There was no news. I shared a taxi back from the Quai d'Orsay with Woolsey and Krum. "What do you do nights, Jake?" asked Krum. "I never see you around." "Oh, I'm over in the Quarter." "I'm coming over some night. The Dingo. That's the great place, isn't it?" "Yes. That, or this new dive, The Select." "I've meant to get over," said Krum. "You know how it is, though, with a wife and kids." "Playing any tennis?" Woolsey asked. "Well, no," said Krum. "I can't say I've played any this year. I've tried to get away, but Sundays it's always rained, and the courts are so damned crowded." "The Englishmen all have Saturday off," Woolsey said. "Lucky beggars," said Krum. "Well, I'll tell you. Some day I'm not going to be working for an agency. Then I'll have plenty of time to get out in the country." "That's the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car." "I've been thinking some about getting a car next year." I banged on the glass. The chauffeur stopped. "Here's my street," I said. "Come in and have a drink." "Thanks, old man," Krum said. Woolsey shook his head. "I've got to file that line he got off this morning." I put a two-franc piece in Krum's hand. "You're crazy, Jake," he said. "This is on me." "It's all on the office, anyway." "Nope. I want to get it." I waved good-by. Krum put his head out. "See you at the lunch on Wednesday." "You bet." I went to the office in the elevator. Robert Cohn was waiting for me. "Hello, Jake," he said. "Going out to lunch?" "Yes. Let me see if there is anything new." "Where will we eat?" "Anywhere." I was looking over my desk. "Where do you want to eat?" "How about Wetzel's? They've got good hors d'oeuvres." In the restaurant we ordered hors d'oeuvres and beer. The sommelier brought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the steins, and cold. There were a dozen different dishes of hors d'oeuvres. "Have any fun last night?" I asked. "No. I don't think so." "How's the writing going?" "Rotten. I can't get this second book going." "That happens to everybody." "Oh, I'm sure of that. It gets me worried, though." "Thought any more about going to South America?" "I mean that." "Well, why don't you start off?" "Frances." "Well," I said, "take her with you." "She wouldn't like it. That isn't the sort of thing she likes. She likes a lot of people around." "Tell her to go to hell." "I can't. I've got certain obligations to her." He shoved the sliced cucumbers away and took a pickled herring. "What do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?" "Her name's Lady Ashley. Brett's her own name. She's a nice girl," I said. "She's getting a divorce and she's going to marry Mike Campbell. He's over in Scotland now. Why?" "She's a remarkably attractive woman." "Isn't she?" "There's a certain quality about her, a certain fineness. She seems to be absolutely fine and straight." "She's very nice." "I don't know how to describe the quality," Cohn said. "I suppose it's breeding." "You sound as though you liked her pretty well." "I do. I shouldn't wonder if I were in love with her." "She's a drunk," I said. "She's in love with Mike Campbell, and she's going to marry him. He's going to be rich as hell some day." "I don't believe she'll ever marry him." "Why not?" "I don't know. I just don't believe it. Have you known her a long time?" "Yes," I said. "She was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the war." "She must have been just a kid then." "She's thirty-four now." "When did she marry Ashley?" "During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the dysentery." "You talk sort of bitter." "Sorry. I didn't mean to. I was just trying to give you the facts." "I don't believe she would marry anybody she didn't love." "Well," I said. "She's done it twice." "I don't believe it." "Well," I said, "don't ask me a lot of fool questions if you don't like the answers." "I didn't ask you that." "You asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley." "I didn't ask you to insult her." "Oh, go to hell." He stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white and angry behind the little plates of hors d'oeuvres. "Sit down," I said. "Don't be a fool." "You've got to take that back." "Oh, cut out the prep-school stuff." "Take it back." "Sure. Anything. I never heard of Brett Ashley. How's that? "No. Not that. About me going to hell." "Oh, don't go to hell," I said. "Stick around. We're just starting lunch." Cohn smiled again and sat down. He seemed glad to sit down. What the hell would he have done if he hadn't sat down? "You say such damned insulting things, Jake." "I'm sorry. I've got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty things." "I know it," Cohn said. "You're really about the best friend I have, Jake." God help you, I thought. "Forget what I said," I said out loud. "I'm sorry." "It's all right. It's fine. I was just sore for a minute." "Good. Let's get something else to eat." After we finished the lunch we walked up to the CafÃ© de la Paix and had coffee. I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held him off it. We talked about one thing and another, and I left him to come to the office. CHAPTER 6 At five o'clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters. They were not very good letters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them. Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar and had a Jack Rose with George the barman. Brett had not been in the bar either, and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a taxi to the CafÃ© Select. Crossing the Seine I saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the sweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris. The taxi rounded the statue of the inventor of the semaphore engaged in doing same, and turned up the Boulevard Raspail, and I sat back to let that part of the ride pass. The Boulevard Raspail always made dull riding. It was like a certain stretch on the P. L. M. between Fontainebleau and Montereau that always made me feel bored and dead and dull until it was over. I suppose it is some association of ideas that makes those dead places in a journey. There are other streets in Paris as ugly as the Boulevard Raspail. It is a street I do not mind walking down at all. But I cannot stand to ride along it. Perhaps I had read something about it once. That was the way Robert Cohn was about all of Paris. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris. Possibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe. So many young men get their likes and dislikes from Mencken. The taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde. No matter what cafÃ© in Montparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank of the river, they always take you to the Rotonde. Ten years from now it will probably be the Dome. It was near enough, anyway. I walked past the sad tables of the Rotonde to the Select. There were a few people inside at the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone. He had a pile of saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave. "Sit down," said Harvey, "I've been looking for you." "What's the matter?" "Nothing. Just looking for you." "Been out to the races?" "No. Not since Sunday." "What do you hear from the States?" "Nothing. Absolutely nothing." "What's the matter?" "I don't know. I'm through with them. I'm absolutely through with them." He leaned forward and looked me in the eye. "Do you want to know something, Jake?" "Yes." "I haven't had anything to eat for five days." I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar. "What's the matter?" "No money. Money hasn't come," he paused. "I tell you it's strange, Jake. When I'm like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my own room. I'm like a cat." I felt in my pocket. "Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?" "Yes." "Come on. Let's go and eat." "There's no hurry. Have a drink." "Better eat." "No. When I get like this I don't care whether I eat or not." We had a drink. Harvey added my saucer to his own pile. "Do you know Mencken, Harvey?" "Yes. Why?" "What's he like?" "He's all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had dinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. 'The trouble is,' he said, 'he's a garter snapper.' That's not bad." "That's not bad." "He's through now," Harvey went on. "He's written about all the things he knows, and now he's on all the things he doesn't know." "I guess he's all right," I said. "I just can't read him." "Oh, nobody reads him now," Harvey said, "except the people that used to read the Alexander Hamilton Institute." "Well," I said. "That was a good thing, too." "Sure," said Harvey. So we sat and thought deeply for a while. "Have another port?" "All right," said Harvey. "There comes Cohn," I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street. "That moron," said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table. "Hello, you bums," he said. "Hello, Robert," Harvey said. "I was just telling Jake here that you're a moron." "What do you mean?" "Tell us right off. Don't think. What would you rather do if you could do anything you wanted?" Cohn started to consider. "Don't think. Bring it right out." "I don't know," Cohn said. "What's it all about, anyway?" "I mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No matter how silly it is." "I don't know," Cohn said. "I think I'd rather play football again with what I know about handling myself, now." "I misjudged you," Harvey said. "You're not a moron. You're only a case of arrested development." "You're awfully funny, Harvey," Cohn said. "Some day somebody will push your face in." Harvey Stone laughed. "You think so. They won't, though. Because it wouldn't make any difference to me. I'm not a fighter." "It would make a difference to you if anybody did it." "No, it wouldn't. That's where you make your big mistake. Because you're not intelligent." "Cut it out about me." "Sure," said Harvey. "It doesn't make any difference to me. You don't mean anything to me." "Come on, Harvey," I said. "Have another porto." "No," he said. "I'm going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake." He walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic. "He always gets me sore," Cohn said. "I can't stand him." "I like him," I said. "I'm fond of him. You don't want to get sore at him." "I know it," Cohn said. "He just gets on my nerves." "Write this afternoon?" "No. I couldn't get it going. It's harder to do than my first book. I'm having a hard time handling it." The sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America early in the spring was gone. Then he had been sure of his work, only with these personal longings for adventure. Now the sureness was gone. Somehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly. The reason is that until he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that would, in any way, detach him from other people. He was nice to watch on the tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he handled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of undergraduate quality about him. If he were in a crowd nothing he said stood out. He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may be called that still, but he was not professionally youthful. I do not believe he thought about his clothes much. Externally he had been formed at Princeton. Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had trained him. He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out. He loved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for instance. On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he fell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces. People beat him who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it. Anyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the CafÃ© Select, and Harvey Stone had just crossed the street. "Come on up to the Lilas," I said. "I have a date." "What time?" "Frances is coming here at seven-fifteen." "There she is." Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street. She was a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and smiled. We watched her cross the street. "Hello," she said, "I'm so glad you're here, Jake. I've been wanting to talk to you." "Hello, Frances," said Cohn. He smiled. "Why, hello, Robert. Are you here?" She went on, talking rapidly. "I've had the darndest time. This one"--shaking her head at Cohn--"didn't come home for lunch." "I wasn't supposed to." "Oh, I know. But you didn't say anything about it to the cook. Then I had a date myself, and Paula wasn't at her office. I went to the Ritz and waited for her, and she never came, and of course I didn't have enough money to lunch at the Ritz----" "What did you do?" "Oh, went out, of course." She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful manner. "I always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I ought to know better. How are you, Jake, anyway?" "Fine." "That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that Brett one." "Don't you like her?" Cohn asked. "I think she's perfectly charming. Don't you?" Cohn said nothing. "Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the Dome? You'll stay here, won't you, Robert? Come on, Jake." We crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table. A boy came up with the Paris Times, and I bought one and opened it. "What's the matter, Frances?" "Oh, nothing," she said, "except that he wants to leave me." "How do you mean?" "Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my mother and every one, and now he doesn't want to do it." "What's the matter?" "He's decided he hasn't lived enough. I knew it would happen when he went to New York." She looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially. "I wouldn't marry him if he doesn't want to. Of course I wouldn't. I wouldn't marry him now for anything. But it does seem to me to be a little late now, after we've waited three years, and I've just gotten my divorce." I said nothing. "We were going to celebrate so, and instead we've just had scenes. It's so childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be reasonable, but he says he just can't do it." "It's rotten luck." "I should say it is rotten luck. I've wasted two years and a half on him now. And I don't know now if any man will ever want to marry me. Two years ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes. All the old ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy about me. Now I don't think I could get anybody." "Sure, you could marry anybody." "No, I don't believe it. And I'm fond of him, too. And I'd like to have children. I always thought we'd have children." She looked at me very brightly. "I never liked children much, but I don't want to think I'll never have them. I always thought I'd have them and then like them." "He's got children." "Oh, yes. He's got children, and he's got money, and he's got a rich mother, and he's written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff; nobody at all. It isn't bad, either. And I haven't got any money at all. I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way." She looked at me again very brightly. "It isn't right. It's my own fault and it's not, too. I ought to have known better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can't marry. Why can't he marry? I'd be a good wife. I'm easy to get along with. I leave him alone. It doesn't do any good." "It's a rotten shame." "Yes, it is a rotten shame. But there's no use talking about it, is there? Come on, let's go back to the cafÃ©." "And of course there isn't anything I can do." "No. Just don't let him know I talked to you. I know what he wants." Now for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. "He wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That's what he wants." "Maybe they won't like it. I don't think he's that way. Really." "You don't know him like I do, Jake. That's what he wants to do. I know it. I know it. That's why he doesn't want to marry. He wants to have a big triumph this fall all by himself." "Want to go back to the cafÃ©?" "Yes. Come on." We got up from the table--they had never brought us a drink--and started across the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from behind the marble-topped table. "Well, what are you smiling at?" Frances asked him. "Feel pretty happy?" "I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets." "Oh, what I've told Jake isn't any secret. Everybody will know it soon enough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version." "What was it? About your going to England?" "Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I'm going to England." "Isn't that fine!" "Yes, that's the way it's done in the very best families. Robert's sending me. He's going to give me two hundred pounds and then I'm going to visit friends. Won't it be lovely? The friends don't know about it, yet." She turned to Cohn and smiled at him. He was not smiling now. "You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren't you, Robert? But I made him give me two hundred. He's really very generous. Aren't you, Robert?" I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn. There are people to whom you could not say insulting things. They give you a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be destroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things. But here was Cohn taking it all. Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly joking to what went on later. "How can you say such things, Frances?" Cohn interrupted. "Listen to him. I'm going to England. I'm going to visit friends. Ever visit friends that didn't want you? Oh, they'll have to take me, all right. 'How do you do, my dear? Such a long time since we've seen you. And how is your dear mother?' Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all her money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person in the world that did. 'And what about Robert?' or else very careful talking around Robert. 'You must be most careful not to mention him, my dear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.' Won't it be fun, Robert? Don't you think it will be fun, Jake?" She turned to me with that terribly bright smile. It was very satisfactory to her to have an audience for this. "And where are you going to be, Robert? It's my own fault, all right. Perfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you'd get rid of me the same way. Jake doesn't know about that. Should I tell him?" "Shut up, Frances, for God's sake." "Yes, I'll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine. Just the sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was wonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful, too. So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to Provincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn't even pay her fare back to the coast. All to please me. He thought I was pretty fine, then. Didn't you, Robert? "You mustn't misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that she was so nice. And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn't that literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert. "You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren't you, Robert? That's why he's leaving me. He's decided I don't film well. You see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing on this book, that he doesn't remember anything about us. So now he's going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something frightfully interesting. "Listen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won't mind, will you? Don't have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you can't have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you can't remember what the other person's said. You'll never be able to remember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm. I know it's awfully hard. But remember, it's for literature. We all ought to make sacrifices for literature. Look at me. I'm going to England without a protest. All for literature. We must all help young writers. Don't you think so, Jake? But you're not a young writer. Are you, Robert? You're thirty-four. Still, I suppose that is young for a great writer. Look at Hardy. Look at Anatole France. He just died a little while ago. Robert doesn't think he's any good, though. Some of his French friends told him. He doesn't read French very well himself. He wasn't a good writer like you are, was he, Robert? Do you think he ever had to go and look for material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he wouldn't marry them? I wonder if he cried, too? Oh, I've just thought of something." She put her gloved hand up to her lips. "I know the real reason why Robert won't marry me, Jake. It's just come to me. They've sent it to me in a vision in the CafÃ© Select. Isn't it mystic? Some day they'll put a tablet up. Like at Lourdes. Do you want to hear, Robert? I'll tell you. It's so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it. Why, you see, Robert's always wanted to have a mistress, and if he doesn't marry me, why, then he's had one. She was his mistress for over two years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he's always promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance. Don't you think that's bright of me to figure that out? It's true, too. Look at him and see if it's not. Where are you going, Jake?" "I've got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute." Cohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there? Why did he keep on taking it like that? As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the window. Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into his face each time she asked: "Isn't it so, Robert?" Or maybe she did not ask that now. Perhaps she said something else. I told the barman I did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. As I went out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and saw them sitting there. She was still talking to him. I went down a side street to the Boulevard Raspail. A taxi came along and I got in and gave the driver the address of my flat. CHAPTER 7 As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the door of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out. She had some letters and a telegram. "Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you." "Did she leave a card?" "No. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night. In the end I find she is very nice." "Was she with a friend of mine?" "I don't know. He was never here before. He was very large. Very, very large. She was very nice. Very, very nice. Last night she was, perhaps, a little--" She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down. "I'll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her not so gentille. Last night I formed another idea of her. But listen to what I tell you. She is trÃ¨s, trÃ¨s gentille. She is of very good family. It is a thing you can see." "They did not leave any word?" "Yes. They said they would be back in an hour." "Send them up when they come." "Yes, Monsieur Barnes. And that lady, that lady there is some one. An eccentric, perhaps, but quelqu'une, quelqu'une!" The concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-selling concession at the Paris race-courses. Her life-work lay in the pelouse, but she kept an eye on the people of the pesage, and she took great pride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which were of good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with the accent on the men. The only trouble was that people who did not fall into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was no one home, chez Barnes. One of my friends, an extremely underfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither well brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter asking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could come up and see me occasionally in the evenings. I went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge. The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the France. I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom, undressed and had a shower. I was rubbing down when I heard the door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door. It was Brett. Back of her was the count. He was holding a great bunch of roses. "Hello, darling," said Brett. "Aren't you going to let us in?" "Come on. I was just bathing." "Aren't you the fortunate man. Bathing." "Only a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?" "I don't know whether you like flowers, sir," the count said, "but I took the liberty of just bringing these roses." "Here, give them to me." Brett took them. "Get me some water in this, Jake." I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and Brett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the dining-room table. "I say. We have had a day." "You don't remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?" "No. Did we have one? I must have been blind." "You were quite drunk, my dear," said the count. "Wasn't I, though? And the count's been a brick, absolutely." "You've got hell's own drag with the concierge now." "I ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs." "Don't be a damned fool." "His," she said, and nodded at the count. "I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It was very late." "He's wonderful," Brett said. "He remembers everything that's happened." "So do you, my dear." "Fancy," said Brett. "Who'd want to? I say, Jake, do we get a drink?" "You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is." "Rather." While I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and then heard them talking. I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt tired and pretty rotten. Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand, and sat on the bed. "What's the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?" She kissed me coolly on the forehead. "Oh, Brett, I love you so much." "Darling," she said. Then: "Do you want me to send him away?" "No. He's nice." "I'll send him away." "No, don't." "Yes, I'll send him away." "You can't just like that." "Can't I, though? You stay here. He's mad about me, I tell you." She was gone out of the room. I lay face down on the bed. I was having a bad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen. Brett came in and sat on the bed. "Poor old darling." She stroked my head. "What did you say to him?" I was lying with my face away from her. I did not want to see her. "Sent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne." Then later: "Do you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?" "It's better." "Lie quiet. He's gone to the other side of town." "Couldn't we live together, Brett? Couldn't we just live together?" "I don't think so. I'd just tromper you with everybody. You couldn't stand it." "I stand it now." "That would be different. It's my fault, Jake. It's the way I'm made." "Couldn't we go off in the country for a while?" "It wouldn't be any good. I'll go if you like. But I couldn't live quietly in the country. Not with my own true love." "I know." "Isn't it rotten? There isn't any use my telling you I love you." "You know I love you." "Let's not talk. Talking's all bilge. I'm going away from you, and then Michael's coming back." "Why are you going away?" "Better for you. Better for me." "When are you going?" "Soon as I can." "Where?" "San Sebastian." "Can't we go together?" "No. That would be a hell of an idea after we'd just talked it out." "We never agreed." "Oh, you know as well as I do. Don't be obstinate, darling." "Oh, sure," I said. "I know you're right. I'm just low, and when I'm low I talk like a fool." I sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on. I stood up. "Don't look like that, darling." "How do you want me to look?" "Oh, don't be a fool. I'm going away to-morrow." "To-morrow?" "Yes. Didn't I say so? I am." "Let's have a drink, then. The count will be back." "Yes. He should be back. You know he's extraordinary about buying champagne. It means any amount to him." We went into the dining-room. I took up the brandy bottle and poured Brett a drink and one for myself. There was a ring at the bell-pull. I went to the door and there was the count. Behind him was the chauffeur carrying a basket of champagne. "Where should I have him put it, sir?" asked the count. "In the kitchen," Brett said. "Put it in there, Henry," the count motioned. "Now go down and get the ice." He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door. "I think you'll find that's very good wine," he said. "I know we don't get much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this from a friend of mine that's in the business." "Oh, you always have some one in the trade," Brett said. "This fellow raises the grapes. He's got thousands of acres of them." "What's his name?" asked Brett. "Veuve Cliquot?" "No," said the count. "Mumms. He's a baron." "Isn't it wonderful," said Brett. "We all have titles. Why haven't you a title, Jake?" "I assure you, sir," the count put his hand on my arm. "It never does a man any good. Most of the time it costs you money." "Oh, I don't know. It's damned useful sometimes," Brett said. "I've never known it to do me any good." "You haven't used it properly. I've had hell's own amount of credit on mine." "Do sit down, count," I said. "Let me take that stick." The count was looking at Brett across the table under the gas-light. She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me notice it. "I say, Jake, I don't want to ruin your rugs. Can't you give a chap an ash-tray?" I found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up with a bucket full of salted ice. "Put two bottles in it, Henry," the count called. "Anything else, sir?" "No. Wait down in the car." He turned to Brett and to me. "We'll want to ride out to the Bois for dinner?" "If you like," Brett said. "I couldn't eat a thing." "I always like a good meal," said the count. "Should I bring the wine in, sir?" asked the chauffeur. "Yes. Bring it in, Henry," said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin cigar-case and offered it to me. "Like to try a real American cigar?" "Thanks," I said. "I'll finish the cigarette." He cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of his watch-chain. "I like a cigar to really draw," said the count "Half the cigars you smoke don't draw." He lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. "And when you're divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won't have a title." "No. What a pity." "No," said the count. "You don't need a title. You got class all over you." "Thanks. Awfully decent of you." "I'm not joking you," the count blew a cloud of smoke. "You got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That's all." "Nice of you," said Brett. "Mummy would be pleased. Couldn't you write it out, and I'll send it in a letter to her." "I'd tell her, too," said the count. "I'm not joking you. I never joke people. Joke people and you make enemies. That's what I always say." "You're right," Brett said. "You're terribly right. I always joke people and I haven't a friend in the world. Except Jake here." "You don't joke him." "That's it." "Do you, now?" asked the count. "Do you joke him?" Brett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes. "No," she said. "I wouldn't joke him." "See," said the count. "You don't joke him." "This is a hell of a dull talk," Brett said. "How about some of that champagne?" The count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket. "It isn't cold, yet. You're always drinking, my dear. Why don't you just talk?" "I've talked too ruddy much. I've talked myself all out to Jake." "I should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you never finish your sentences at all." "Leave 'em for you to finish. Let any one finish them as they like." "It is a very interesting system," the count reached down and gave the bottles a twirl. "Still I would like to hear you talk some time." "Isn't he a fool?" Brett asked. "Now," the count brought up a bottle. "I think this is cool." I brought a towel and he wiped the bottle dry and held it up. "I like to drink champagne from magnums. The wine is better but it would have been too hard to cool." He held the bottle, looking at it. I put out the glasses. "I say. You might open it," Brett suggested. "Yes, my dear. Now I'll open it." It was amazing champagne. "I say that is wine," Brett held up her glass. "We ought to toast something. 'Here's to royalty.'" "This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. You don't want to mix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste." Brett's glass was empty. "You ought to write a book on wines, count," I said. "Mr. Barnes," answered the count, "all I want out of wines is to enjoy them." "Let's enjoy a little more of this," Brett pushed her glass forward. The count poured very carefully. "There, my dear. Now you enjoy that slowly, and then you can get drunk." "Drunk? Drunk?" "My dear, you are charming when you are drunk." "Listen to the man." "Mr. Barnes," the count poured my glass full. "She is the only lady I have ever known who was as charming when she was drunk as when she was sober." "You haven't been around much, have you?" "Yes, my dear. I have been around very much. I have been around a very great deal." "Drink your wine," said Brett. "We've all been around. I dare say Jake here has seen as much as you have." "My dear, I am sure Mr. Barnes has seen a lot. Don't think I don't think so, sir. I have seen a lot, too." "Of course you have, my dear," Brett said. "I was only ragging." "I have been in seven wars and four revolutions," the count said. "Soldiering?" Brett asked. "Sometimes, my dear. And I have got arrow wounds. Have you ever seen arrow wounds?" "Let's have a look at them." The count stood up, unbuttoned his vest, and opened his shirt. He pulled up the undershirt onto his chest and stood, his chest black, and big stomach muscles bulging under the light. "You see them?" Below the line where his ribs stopped were two raised white welts. "See on the back where they come out." Above the small of the back were the same two scars, raised as thick as a finger. "I say. Those are something." "Clean through." The count was tucking in his shirt. "Where did you get those?" I asked. "In Abyssinia. When I was twenty-one years old." "What were you doing?" asked Brett. "Were you in the army?" "I was on a business trip, my dear." "I told you he was one of us. Didn't I?" Brett turned to me. "I love you, count. You're a darling." "You make me very happy, my dear. But it isn't true." "Don't be an ass." "You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well. Don't you find it like that?" "Yes. Absolutely." "I know," said the count. "That is the secret. You must get to know the values." "Doesn't anything ever happen to your values?" Brett asked. "No. Not any more." "Never fall in love?" "Always," said the count. "I am always in love." "What does that do to your values?" "That, too, has got a place in my values." "You haven't any values. You're dead, that's all." "No, my dear. You're not right. I'm not dead at all." We drank three bottles of the champagne and the count left the basket in my kitchen. We dined at a restaurant in the Bois. It was a good dinner. Food had an excellent place in the count's values. So did wine. The count was in fine form during the meal. So was Brett. It was a good party. "Where would you like to go?" asked the count after dinner. We were the only people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over against the door. They wanted to go home. "We might go up on the hill," Brett said. "Haven't we had a splendid party?" The count was beaming. He was very happy. "You are very nice people," he said. He was smoking a cigar again. "Why don't you get married, you two?" "We want to lead our own lives," I said. "We have our careers," Brett said. "Come on. Let's get out of this." "Have another brandy," the count said. "Get it on the hill." "No. Have it here where it is quiet." "You and your quiet," said Brett. "What is it men feel about quiet?" "We like it," said the count. "Like you like noise, my dear." "All right," said Brett. "Let's have one." "Sommelier!" the count called. "Yes, sir." "What is the oldest brandy you have?" "Eighteen eleven, sir." "Bring us a bottle." "I say. Don't be ostentatious. Call him off, Jake." "Listen, my dear. I get more value for my money in old brandy than in any other antiquities." "Got many antiquities?" "I got a houseful." Finally we went up to Montmartre. Inside Zelli's it was crowded, smoky, and noisy. The music hit you as you went in. Brett and I danced. It was so crowded we could barely move. The nigger drummer waved at Brett. We were caught in the jam, dancing in one place in front of him. "Hahre you?" "Great." "Thaats good." He was all teeth and lips. "He's a great friend of mine," Brett said. "Damn good drummer." The music stopped and we started toward the table where the count sat. Then the music started again and we danced. I looked at the count. He was sitting at the table smoking a cigar. The music stopped again. "Let's go over." Brett started toward the table. The music started and again we danced, tight in the crowd. "You are a rotten dancer, Jake. Michael's the best dancer I know." "He's splendid." "He's got his points." "I like him," I said. "I'm damned fond of him." "I'm going to marry him," Brett said. "Funny. I haven't thought about him for a week." "Don't you write him?" "Not I. Never write letters." "I'll bet he writes to you." "Rather. Damned good letters, too." "When are you going to get married?" "How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael's trying to get his mother to put up for it." "Could I help you?" "Don't be an ass. Michael's people have loads of money." The music stopped. We walked over to the table. The count stood up. "Very nice," he said. "You looked very, very nice." "Don't you dance, count?" I asked. "No. I'm too old." "Oh, come off it," Brett said. "My dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you dance." "Splendid," Brett said. "I'll dance again for you some time. I say. What about your little friend, Zizi?" "Let me tell you. I support that boy, but I don't want to have him around." "He is rather hard." "You know I think that boy's got a future. But personally I don't want him around." "Jake's rather the same way." "He gives me the willys." "Well," the count shrugged his shoulders. "About his future you can't ever tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father." "Come on. Let's dance," Brett said. We danced. It was crowded and close. "Oh, darling," Brett said, "I'm so miserable." I had that feeling of going through something that has all happened before. "You were happy a minute ago." The drummer shouted: "You can't two time--" "It's all gone." "What's the matter?" "I don't know. I just feel terribly." "......" the drummer chanted. Then turned to his sticks. "Want to go?" I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated, something I had been through and that now I must go through again. "......" the drummer sang softly. "Let's go," said Brett. "You don't mind." "......" the drummer shouted and grinned at Brett. "All right," I said. We got out from the crowd. Brett went to the dressing-room. "Brett wants to go," I said to the count. He nodded. "Does she? That's fine. You take the car. I'm going to stay here for a while, Mr. Barnes." We shook hands. "It was a wonderful time," I said. "I wish you would let me get this." I took a note out of my pocket. "Mr. Barnes, don't be ridiculous," the count said. Brett came over with her wrap on. She kissed the count and put her hand on his shoulder to keep him from standing up. As we went out the door I looked back and there were three girls at his table. We got into the big car. Brett gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel. "No, don't come up," she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door was unlatched. "Really?" "No. Please." "Good night, Brett," I said. "I'm sorry you feel rotten." "Good night, Jake. Good night, darling. I won't see you again." We kissed standing at the door. She pushed me away. We kissed again. "Oh, don't!" Brett said. She turned quickly and went into the hotel. The chauffeur drove me around to my flat. I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap and said: "Good night, sir," and drove off. I rang the bell. The door opened and I went up-stairs and went to bed. BOOK II CHAPTER 8 I did not see Brett again until she came back from San Sebastian. One card came from her from there. It had a picture of the Concha, and said: "Darling. Very quiet and healthy. Love to all the chaps. BRETT." Nor did I see Robert Cohn again. I heard Frances had left for England and I had a note from Cohn saying he was going out in the country for a couple of weeks, he did not know where, but that he wanted to hold me to the fishing-trip in Spain we had talked about last winter. I could reach him always, he wrote, through his bankers. Brett was gone, I was not bothered by Cohn's troubles, I rather enjoyed not having to play tennis, there was plenty of work to do, I went often to the races, dined with friends, and put in some extra time at the office getting things ahead so I could leave it in charge of my secretary when Bill Gorton and I should shove off to Spain the end of June. Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went off to Vienna. He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful. New York was wonderful. There had been a grand theatrical season and a whole crop of great young light heavyweights. Any one of them was a good prospect to grow up, put on weight and trim Dempsey. Bill was very happy. He had made a lot of money on his last book, and was going to make a lot more. We had a good time while he was in Paris, and then he went off to Vienna. He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave for Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona. He wrote that Vienna was wonderful. Then a card from Budapest: "Jake, Budapest is wonderful." Then I got a wire: "Back on Monday." Monday evening he turned up at the flat. I heard his taxi stop and went to the window and called to him; he waved and started up-stairs carrying his bags. I met him on the stairs, and took one of the bags. "Well," I said, "I hear you had a wonderful trip." "Wonderful," he said. "Budapest is absolutely wonderful." "How about Vienna?" "Not so good, Jake. Not so good. It seemed better than it was." "How do you mean?" I was getting glasses and a siphon. "Tight, Jake. I was tight." "That's strange. Better have a drink." Bill rubbed his forehead. "Remarkable thing," he said. "Don't know how it happened. Suddenly it happened." "Last long?" "Four days, Jake. Lasted just four days." "Where did you go?" "Don't remember. Wrote you a post-card. Remember that perfectly." "Do anything else?" "Not so sure. Possible." "Go on. Tell me about it." "Can't remember. Tell you anything I could remember." "Go on. Take that drink and remember." "Might remember a little," Bill said. "Remember something about a prize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember the nigger perfectly." "Go on." "Wonderful nigger. Looked like Tiger Flowers, only four times as big. All of a sudden everybody started to throw things. Not me. Nigger'd just knocked local boy down. Nigger put up his glove. Wanted to make a speech. Awful noble-looking nigger. Started to make a speech. Then local white boy hit him. Then he knocked white boy cold. Then everybody commenced to throw chairs. Nigger went home with us in our car. Couldn't get his clothes. Wore my coat. Remember the whole thing now. Big sporting evening." "What happened?" "Loaned the nigger some clothes and went around with him to try and get his money. Claimed nigger owed them money on account of wrecking hall. Wonder who translated? Was it me?" "Probably it wasn't you." "You're right. Wasn't me at all. Was another fellow. Think we called him the local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music." "How'd you come out?" "Not so good, Jake. Injustice everywhere. Promoter claimed nigger promised let local boy stay. Claimed nigger violated contract. Can't knock out Vienna boy in Vienna. 'My God, Mister Gorton,' said nigger, 'I didn't do nothing in there for forty minutes but try and let him stay. That white boy musta ruptured himself swinging at me. I never did hit him.'" "Did you get any money?" "No money, Jake. All we could get was nigger's clothes. Somebody took his watch, too. Splendid nigger. Big mistake to have come to Vienna. Not so good, Jake. Not so good." "What became of the nigger?" "Went back to Cologne. Lives there. Married. Got a family. Going to write me a letter and send me the money I loaned him. Wonderful nigger. Hope I gave him the right address." "You probably did." "Well, anyway, let's eat," said Bill. "Unless you want me to tell you some more travel stories." "Go on." "Let's eat." We went down-stairs and out onto the Boulevard St. Michel in the warm June evening. "Where will we go?" "Want to eat on the island?" "Sure." We walked down the Boulevard. At the juncture of the Rue Denfert-Rochereau with the Boulevard is a statue of two men in flowing robes. "I know who they are." Bill eyed the monument. "Gentlemen who invented pharmacy. Don't try and fool me on Paris." We went on. "Here's a taxidermist's," Bill said. "Want to buy anything? Nice stuffed dog?" "Come on," I said. "You're pie-eyed." "Pretty nice stuffed dogs," Bill said. "Certainly brighten up your flat." "Come on." "Just one stuffed dog. I can take 'em or leave 'em alone. But listen, Jake. Just one stuffed dog." "Come on." "Mean everything in the world to you after you bought it. Simple exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog." "We'll get one on the way back." "All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with unbought stuffed dogs. Not my fault." We went on. "How'd you feel that way about dogs so sudden?" "Always felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed animals." We stopped and had a drink. "Certainly like to drink," Bill said. "You ought to try it some times, Jake." "You're about a hundred and forty-four ahead of me." "Ought not to daunt you. Never be daunted. Secret of my success. Never been daunted. Never been daunted in public." "Where were you drinking?" "Stopped at the Crillon. George made me a couple of Jack Roses. George's a great man. Know the secret of his success? Never been daunted." "You'll be daunted after about three more pernods." "Not in public. If I begin to feel daunted I'll go off by myself. I'm like a cat that way." "When did you see Harvey Stone?" "At the Crillon. Harvey was just a little daunted. Hadn't eaten for three days. Doesn't eat any more. Just goes off like a cat. Pretty sad." "He's all right." "Splendid. Wish he wouldn't keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me nervous." "What'll we do to-night?" "Doesn't make any difference. Only let's not get daunted. Suppose they got any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we wouldn't have to go all the way down to the island to eat." "Nix," I said. "We're going to have a regular meal." "Just a suggestion," said Bill. "Want to start now?" "Come on." We started on again down the Boulevard. A horse-cab passed us. Bill looked at it. "See that horse-cab? Going to have that horse-cab stuffed for you for Christmas. Going to give all my friends stuffed animals. I'm a nature-writer." A taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop. The taxi backed up to the curb. In it was Brett. "Beautiful lady," said Bill. "Going to kidnap us." "Hullo!" Brett said. "Hullo!" "This is Bill Gorton. Lady Ashley." Brett smiled at Bill. "I say I'm just back. Haven't bathed even. Michael comes in to-night." "Good. Come on and eat with us, and we'll all go to meet him." "Must clean myself." "Oh, rot! Come on." "Must bathe. He doesn't get in till nine." "Come and have a drink, then, before you bathe." "Might do that. Now you're not talking rot." We got in the taxi. The driver looked around. "Stop at the nearest bistro," I said. "We might as well go to the Closerie," Brett said. "I can't drink these rotten brandies." "Closerie des Lilas." Brett turned to Bill. "Have you been in this pestilential city long?" "Just got in to-day from Budapest." "How was Budapest?" "Wonderful. Budapest was wonderful." "Ask him about Vienna." "Vienna," said Bill, "is a strange city." "Very much like Paris," Brett smiled at him, wrinkling the corners of her eyes. "Exactly," Bill said. "Very much like Paris at this moment." "You have a good start." Sitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and soda, I took one, too, and Bill took another pernod. "How are you, Jake?" "Great," I said. "I've had a good time." Brett looked at me. "I was a fool to go away," she said. "One's an ass to leave Paris." "Did you have a good time?" "Oh, all right. Interesting. Not frightfully amusing." "See anybody?" "No, hardly anybody. I never went out." "Didn't you swim?" "No. Didn't do a thing." "Sounds like Vienna," Bill said. Brett wrinkled up the corners of her eyes at him. "So that's the way it was in Vienna." "It was like everything in Vienna." Brett smiled at him again. "You've a nice friend, Jake." "He's all right," I said. "He's a taxidermist." "That was in another country," Bill said. "And besides all the animals were dead." "One more," Brett said, "and I must run. Do send the waiter for a taxi." "There's a line of them. Right out in front." "Good." We had the drink and put Brett into her taxi. "Mind you're at the Select around ten. Make him come. Michael will be there." "We'll be there," Bill said. The taxi started and Brett waved. "Quite a girl," Bill said. "She's damned nice. Who's Michael?" "The man she's going to marry." "Well, well," Bill said. "That's always just the stage I meet anybody. What'll I send them? Think they'd like a couple of stuffed race-horses?" "We better eat." "Is she really Lady something or other?" Bill asked in the taxi on our way down to the Ile Saint Louis. "Oh, yes. In the stud-book and everything." "Well, well." We ate dinner at Madame Lecomte's restaurant on the far side of the island. It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait for a place. Some one had put it in the American Women's Club list as a quaint restaurant on the Paris quais as yet untouched by Americans, so we had to wait forty-five minutes for a table. Bill had eaten at the restaurant in 1918, and right after the armistice, and Madame Lecomte made a great fuss over seeing him. "Doesn't get us a table, though," Bill said. "Grand woman, though." We had a good meal, a roast chicken, new green beans, mashed potatoes, a salad, and some apple-pie and cheese. "You've got the world here all right," Bill said to Madame Lecomte. She raised her hand. "Oh, my God!" "You'll be rich." "I hope so." After the coffee and a fine we got the bill, chalked up the same as ever on a slate, that was doubtless one of the "quaint" features, paid it, shook hands, and went out. "You never come here any more, Monsieur Barnes," Madame Lecomte said. "Too many compatriots." "Come at lunch-time. It's not crowded then." "Good. I'll be down soon." We walked along under the trees that grew out over the river on the Quai d'OrlÃ©ans side of the island. Across the river were the broken walls of old houses that were being torn down. "They're going to cut a street through." "They would," Bill said. We walked on and circled the island. The river was dark and a bateau mouche went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out of sight under the bridge. Down the river was Notre Dame squatting against the night sky. We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the wooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge and looked down the river at Notre Dame. Standing on the bridge the island looked dark, the houses were high against the sky, and the trees were shadows. "It's pretty grand," Bill said. "God, I love to get back." We leaned on the wooden rail of the bridge and looked up the river to the lights of the big bridges. Below the water was smooth and black. It made no sound against the piles of the bridge. A man and a girl passed us. They were walking with their arms around each other. We crossed the bridge and walked up the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine. It was steep walking, and we went all the way up to the Place Contrescarpe. The arc-light shone through the leaves of the trees in the square, and underneath the trees was an S bus ready to start. Music came out of the door of the Negre Joyeux. Through the window of the CafÃ© Aux Amateurs I saw the long zinc bar. Outside on the terrace working people were drinking. In the open kitchen of the Amateurs a girl was cooking potato-chips in oil. There was an iron pot of stew. The girl ladled some onto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in one hand. "Want to have a drink?" "No," said Bill. "I don't need it." We turned to the right off the Place Contrescarpe, walking along smooth narrow streets with high old houses on both sides. Some of the houses jutted out toward the street. Others were cut back. We came onto the Rue du Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid north and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south, past Val de GrÃ¢ce, set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the Boulevard du Port Royal. "What do you want to do?" I asked. "Go up to the cafÃ© and see Brett and Mike?" "Why not?" We walked along Port Royal until it became Montparnasse, and then on past the Lilas, Lavigne's, and all the little cafÃ©s, Damoy's, crossed the street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select. Michael came toward us from the tables. He was tanned and healthy-looking. "Hel-lo, Jake," he said. "Hel-lo! Hel-lo! How are you, old lad?" "You look very fit, Mike." "Oh, I am. I'm frightfully fit. I've done nothing but walk. Walk all day long. One drink a day with my mother at tea." Bill had gone into the bar. He was standing talking with Brett, who was sitting on a high stool, her legs crossed. She had no stockings on. "It's good to see you, Jake," Michael said. "I'm a little tight you know. Amazing, isn't it? Did you see my nose?" There was a patch of dried blood on the bridge of his nose. "An old lady's bags did that," Mike said. "I reached up to help her with them and they fell on me." Brett gestured at him from the bar with her cigarette-holder and wrinkled the corners of her eyes. "An old lady," said Mike. "Her bags fell on me. Let's go in and see Brett. I say, she is a piece. You are a lovely lady, Brett. Where did you get that hat?" "Chap bought it for me. Don't you like it?" "It's a dreadful hat. Do get a good hat." "Oh, we've so much money now," Brett said. "I say, haven't you met Bill yet? You are a lovely host, Jake." She turned to Mike. "This is Bill Gorton. This drunkard is Mike Campbell. Mr. Campbell is an undischarged bankrupt." "Aren't I, though? You know I met my ex-partner yesterday in London. Chap who did me in." "What did he say?" "Bought me a drink. I thought I might as well take it. I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece. Don't you think she's beautiful?" "Beautiful. With this nose?" "It's a lovely nose. Go on, point it at me. Isn't she a lovely piece?" "Couldn't we have kept the man in Scotland?" "I say, Brett, let's turn in early." "Don't be indecent, Michael. Remember there are ladies at this bar." "Isn't she a lovely piece? Don't you think so, Jake?" "There's a fight to-night," Bill said. "Like to go?" "Fight," said Mike. "Who's fighting?" "Ledoux and somebody." "He's very good, Ledoux," Mike said. "I'd like to see it, rather"--he was making an effort to pull himself together--"but I can't go. I had a date with this thing here. I say, Brett, do get a new hat." Brett pulled the felt hat down far over one eye and smiled out from under it. "You two run along to the fight. I'll have to be taking Mr. Campbell home directly." "I'm not tight," Mike said. "Perhaps just a little. I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece." "Go on to the fight," Brett said. "Mr. Campbell's getting difficult. What are these outbursts of affection, Michael?" "I say, you are a lovely piece." We said good night. "I'm sorry I can't go," Mike said. Brett laughed. I looked back from the door. Mike had one hand on the bar and was leaning toward Brett, talking. Brett was looking at him quite coolly, but the corners of her eyes were smiling. Outside on the pavement I said: "Do you want to go to the fight?" "Sure," said Bill. "If we don't have to walk." "Mike was pretty excited about his girl friend," I said in the taxi. "Well," said Bill. "You can't blame him such a hell of a lot." CHAPTER 9 The Ledoux-Kid Francis fight was the night of the 20th of June. It was a good fight. The morning after the fight I had a letter from Robert Cohn, written from Hendaye. He was having a very quiet time, he said, bathing, playing some golf and much bridge. Hendaye had a splendid beach, but he was anxious to start on the fishing-trip. When would I be down? If I would buy him a double-tapered line he would pay me when I came down. That same morning I wrote Cohn from the office that Bill and I would leave Paris on the 25th unless I wired him otherwise, and would meet him at Bayonne, where we could get a bus over the mountains to Pamplona. The same evening about seven o'clock I stopped in at the Select to see Michael and Brett. They were not there, and I went over to the Dingo. They were inside sitting at the bar. "Hello, darling." Brett put out her hand. "Hello, Jake," Mike said. "I understand I was tight last night." "Weren't you, though," Brett said. "Disgraceful business." "Look," said Mike, "when do you go down to Spain? Would you mind if we came down with you?" "It would be grand." "You wouldn't mind, really? I've been at Pamplona, you know. Brett's mad to go. You're sure we wouldn't just be a bloody nuisance?" "Don't talk like a fool." "I'm a little tight, you know. I wouldn't ask you like this if I weren't. You're sure you don't mind?" "Oh, shut up, Michael," Brett said. "How can the man say he'd mind now? I'll ask him later." "But you don't mind, do you?" "Don't ask that again unless you want to make me sore. Bill and I go down on the morning of the 25th." "By the way, where is Bill?" Brett asked. "He's out at Chantilly dining with some people." "He's a good chap." "Splendid chap," said Mike. "He is, you know." "You don't remember him," Brett said. "I do. Remember him perfectly. Look, Jake, we'll come down the night of the 25th. Brett can't get up in the morning." "Indeed not!" "If our money comes and you're sure you don't mind." "It will come, all right. I'll see to that." "Tell me what tackle to send for." "Get two or three rods with reels, and lines, and some flies." "I won't fish," Brett put in. "Get two rods, then, and Bill won't have to buy one." "Right," said Mike. "I'll send a wire to the keeper." "Won't it be splendid," Brett said. "Spain! We will have fun." "The 25th. When is that?" "Saturday." "We will have to get ready." "I say," said Mike, "I'm going to the barber's." "I must bathe," said Brett. "Walk up to the hotel with me, Jake. Be a good chap." "We have got the loveliest hotel," Mike said. "I think it's a brothel!" "We left our bags here at the Dingo when we got in, and they asked us at this hotel if we wanted a room for the afternoon only. Seemed frightfully pleased we were going to stay all night." "I believe it's a brothel," Mike said. "And I should know." "Oh, shut it and go and get your hair cut." Mike went out. Brett and I sat on at the bar. "Have another?" "Might." "I needed that," Brett said. We walked up the Rue Delambre. "I haven't seen you since I've been back," Brett said. "No." "How are you, Jake?" "Fine." Brett looked at me. "I say," she said, "is Robert Cohn going on this trip?" "Yes. Why?" "Don't you think it will be a bit rough on him?" "Why should it?" "Who did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?" "Congratulations," I said. We walked along. "What did you say that for?" "I don't know. What would you like me to say?" We walked along and turned a corner. "He behaved rather well, too. He gets a little dull." "Does he?" "I rather thought it would be good for him." "You might take up social service." "Don't be nasty." "I won't." "Didn't you really know?" "No," I said. "I guess I didn't think about it." "Do you think it will be too rough on him?" "That's up to him," I said. "Tell him you're coming. He can always not come." "I'll write him and give him a chance to pull out of it." I did not see Brett again until the night of the 24th of June. "Did you hear from Cohn?" "Rather. He's keen about it." "My God!" "I thought it was rather odd myself." "Says he can't wait to see me." "Does he think you're coming alone?" "No. I told him we were all coming down together. Michael and all." "He's wonderful." "Isn't he?" They expected their money the next day. We arranged to meet at Pamplona. They would go directly to San Sebastian and take the train from there. We would all meet at the Montoya in Pamplona. If they did not turn up on Monday at the latest we would go on ahead up to Burguete in the mountains, to start fishing. There was a bus to Burguete. I wrote out an itinerary so they could follow us. Bill and I took the morning train from the Gare d'Orsay. It was a lovely day, not too hot, and the country was beautiful from the start. We went back into the diner and had breakfast. Leaving the dining-car I asked the conductor for tickets for the first service. "Nothing until the fifth." "What's this?" There were never more than two servings of lunch on that train, and always plenty of places for both of them. "They're all reserved," the dining-car conductor said. "There will be a fifth service at three-thirty." "This is serious," I said to Bill. "Give him ten francs." "Here," I said. "We want to eat in the first service." The conductor put the ten francs in his pocket. "Thank you," he said. "I would advise you gentlemen to get some sandwiches. All the places for the first four services were reserved at the office of the company." "You'll go a long way, brother," Bill said to him in English. "I suppose if I'd given you five francs you would have advised us to jump off the train." "Comment?" "Go to hell!" said Bill. "Get the sandwiches made and a bottle of wine. You tell him, Jake." "And send it up to the next car." I described where we were. In our compartment were a man and his wife and their young son. "I suppose you're Americans, aren't you?" the man asked. "Having a good trip?" "Wonderful," said Bill. "That's what you want to do. Travel while you're young. Mother and I always wanted to get over, but we had to wait a while." "You could have come over ten years ago, if you'd wanted to," the wife said. "What you always said was: 'See America first!' I will say we've seen a good deal, take it one way and another." "Say, there's plenty of Americans on this train," the husband said. "They've got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They've been on a pilgrimage to Rome, and now they're going down to Biarritz and Lourdes." "So, that's what they are. Pilgrims. Goddam Puritans," Bill said. "What part of the States you boys from?" "Kansas City," I said. "He's from Chicago." "You both going to Biarritz?" "No. We're going fishing in Spain." "Well, I never cared for it, myself. There's plenty that do out where I come from, though. We got some of the best fishing in the State of Montana. I've been out with the boys, but I never cared for it any." "Mighty little fishing you did on them trips," his wife said. He winked at us. "You know how the ladies are. If there's a jug goes along, or a case of beer, they think it's hell and damnation." "That's the way men are," his wife said to us. She smoothed her comfortable lap. "I voted against prohibition to please him, and because I like a little beer in the house, and then he talks that way. It's a wonder they ever find any one to marry them." "Say," said Bill, "do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?" "How do you mean? They can't do a thing like that." "You try and get seats." "Well, mother, it looks as though we better go back and get another breakfast." She stood up and straightened her dress. "Will you boys keep an eye on our things? Come on, Hubert." They all three went up to the wagon restaurant. A little while after they were gone a steward went through announcing the first service, and pilgrims, with their priests, commenced filing down the corridor. Our friend and his family did not come back. A waiter passed in the corridor with our sandwiches and the bottle of Chablis, and we called him in. "You're going to work to-day," I said. He nodded his head. "They start now, at ten-thirty." "When do we eat?" "Huh! When do I eat?" He left two glasses for the bottle, and we paid him for the sandwiches and tipped him. "I'll get the plates," he said, "or bring them with you." We ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out of the window. The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were full of poppies. The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees, and sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees. At Tours we got off and bought another bottle of wine, and when we got back in the compartment the gentleman from Montana and his wife and his son, Hubert, were sitting comfortably. "Is there good swimming in Biarritz?" asked Hubert. "That boy's just crazy till he can get in the water," his mother said. "It's pretty hard on youngsters travelling." "There's good swimming," I said. "But it's dangerous when it's rough." "Did you get a meal?" Bill asked. "We sure did. We set right there when they started to come in, and they must have just thought we were in the party. One of the waiters said something to us in French, and then they just sent three of them back." "They thought we were snappers, all right," the man said. "It certainly shows you the power of the Catholic Church. It's a pity you boys ain't Catholics. You could get a meal, then, all right." "I am," I said. "That's what makes me so sore." Finally at a quarter past four we had lunch. Bill had been rather difficult at the last. He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with one of the returning streams of pilgrims. "When do us Protestants get a chance to eat, father?" "I don't know anything about it. Haven't you got tickets?" "It's enough to make a man join the Klan," Bill said. The priest looked back at him. Inside the dining-car the waiters served the fifth successive table d'hÃ´te meal. The waiter who served us was soaked through. His white jacket was purple under the arms. "He must drink a lot of wine." "Or wear purple undershirts." "Let's ask him." "No. He's too tired." The train stopped for half an hour at Bordeaux and we went out through the station for a little walk. There was not time to get in to the town. Afterward we passed through the Landes and watched the sun set. There were wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them like avenues and see wooded hills way off. About seven-thirty we had dinner and watched the country through the open window in the diner. It was all sandy pine country full of heather. There were little clearings with houses in them, and once in a while we passed a sawmill. It got dark and we could feel the country hot and sandy and dark outside of the window, and about nine o'clock we got into Bayonne. The man and his wife and Hubert all shook hands with us. They were going on to LaNegresse to change for Biarritz. "Well, I hope you have lots of luck," he said. "Be careful about those bull-fights." "Maybe we'll see you at Biarritz," Hubert said. We got off with our bags and rod-cases and passed through the dark station and out to the lights and the line of cabs and hotel buses. There, standing with the hotel runners, was Robert Cohn. He did not see us at first. Then he started forward. "Hello, Jake. Have a good trip?" "Fine," I said. "This is Bill Gorton." "How are you?" "Come on," said Robert. "I've got a cab." He was a little near-sighted. I had never noticed it before. He was looking at Bill, trying to make him out. He was shy, too. "We'll go up to my hotel. It's all right. It's quite nice." We got into the cab, and the cabman put the bags up on the seat beside him and climbed up and cracked his whip, and we drove over the dark bridge and into the town. "I'm awfully glad to meet you," Robert said to Bill. "I've heard so much about you from Jake and I've read your books. Did you get my line, Jake?" The cab stopped in front of the hotel and we all got out and went in. It was a nice hotel, and the people at the desk were very cheerful, and we each had a good small room. CHAPTER 10 In the morning it was bright, and they were sprinkling the streets of the town, and we all had breakfast in a cafÃ©. Bayonne is a nice town. It is like a very clean Spanish town and it is on a big river. Already, so early in the morning, it was very hot on the bridge across the river. We walked out on the bridge and then took a walk through the town. I was not at all sure Mike's rods would come from Scotland in time, so we hunted a tackle store and finally bought a rod for Bill up-stairs over a drygoods store. The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had to wait for him to come back. Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty good rod cheap, and two landing-nets. We went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral. Cohn made some remark about it being a very good example of something or other, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches. Then we went up past the old fort and out to the local Syndicat d'Initiative office, where the bus was supposed to start from. There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1st of July. We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a motor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the corner from the Municipal Theatre for four hundred francs. The car was to pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the cafÃ© on the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer. It was hot, but the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant sitting in the cafÃ©. A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that the air came from the sea. There were pigeons out in the square, and the houses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the cafÃ©. But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the bill. We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went up to the hotel. It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with ten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and waited for Robert Cohn. While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. I pointed him out to Bill and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just come in from the garden. It was really an awfully clean hotel. Cohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car. It was a big, closed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs, and we had him put the back of the car down. He piled in the bags and we started off up the street and out of the town. We passed some lovely gardens and had a good look back at the town, and then we were out in the country, green and rolling, and the road climbing all the time. We passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered. In the Basque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and villages look well-off and clean. Every village had a pelota court and on some of them kids were playing in the hot sun. There were signs on the walls of the churches saying it was forbidden to play pelota against them, and the houses in the villages had red tiled roofs, and then the road turned off and commenced to climb and we were going way up close along a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretched off back toward the sea. You couldn't see the sea. It was too far away. You could see only hills and more hills, and you knew where the sea was. We crossed the Spanish frontier. There was a little stream and a bridge, and Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats, and short guns on their backs, on one side, and on the other fat Frenchmen in kepis and mustaches. They only opened one bag and took the passports in and looked at them. There was a general store and inn on each side of the line. The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the car and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any trout. Bill tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it did not go very well. Robert Cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if there were any trout in the stream, and the carabineer said yes, but not many. I asked him if he ever fished, and he said no, that he didn't care for it. Just then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes that looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up to the bridge. He was carrying a long staff, and he had a kid slung on his back, tied by the four legs, the head hanging down. The carabineer waved him back with his sword. The man turned without saying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain. "What's the matter with the old one?" I asked. "He hasn't got any passport." I offered the guard a cigarette. He took it and thanked me. "What will he do?" I asked. The guard spat in the dust. "Oh, he'll just wade across the stream." "Do you have much smuggling?" "Oh," he said, "they go through." The chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the inside pocket of his coat. We all got in the car and it started up the white dusty road into Spain. For a while the country was much as it had been; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col, the road winding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain. There were long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of beech-trees on some of the mountainsides. The road went along the summit of the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow up, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in the road. We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest, and there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went through a gloomy little village, and started to climb again. We climbed up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road ran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to the south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes. After a while we came out of the mountains, and there were trees along both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the road went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and shifting in the wind. I was up in front with the driver and I turned around. Robert Cohn was asleep, but Bill looked and nodded his head. Then we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right shining in the sun from between the line of trees, and away off you could see the plateau of Pamplona rising out of the plain, and the walls of the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of the other churches. In back of the plateau were the mountains, and every way you looked there were other mountains, and ahead the road stretched out white across the plain going toward Pamplona. We came into the town on the other side of the plateau, the road slanting up steeply and dustily with shade-trees on both sides, and then levelling out through the new part of town they are building up outside the old walls. We passed the bull-ring, high and white and concrete-looking in the sun, and then came into the big square by a side street and stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya. The driver helped us down with the bags. There was a crowd of kids watching the car, and the square was hot, and the trees were green, and the flags hung on their staffs, and it was good to get out of the sun and under the shade of the arcade that runs all the way around the square. Montoya was glad to see us, and shook hands and gave us good rooms looking out on the square, and then we washed and cleaned up and went down-stairs in the dining-room for lunch. The driver stayed for lunch, too, and afterward we paid him and he started back to Bayonne. There are two dining-rooms in the Montoya. One is up-stairs on the second floor and looks out on the square. The other is down one floor below the level of the square and has a door that opens on the back street that the bulls pass along when they run through the streets early in the morning on their way to the ring. It is always cool in the down-stairs dining-room and we had a very good lunch. The first meal in Spain was always a shock with the hors d'oeuvres, an egg course, two meat courses, vegetables, salad, and dessert and fruit. You have to drink plenty of wine to get it all down. Robert Cohn tried to say he did not want any of the second meat course, but we would not interpret for him, and so the waitress brought him something else as a replacement, a plate of cold meats, I think. Cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had met at Bayonne. He did not know whether we knew Brett had been with him at San Sebastian, and it made him rather awkward. "Well," I said, "Brett and Mike ought to get in to-night." "I'm not sure they'll come," Cohn said. "Why not?" Bill said. "Of course they'll come." "They're always late," I said. "I rather think they're not coming," Robert Cohn said. He said it with an air of superior knowledge that irritated both of us. "I'll bet you fifty pesetas they're here to-night," Bill said. He always bets when he is angered, and so he usually bets foolishly. "I'll take it," Cohn said. "Good. You remember it, Jake. Fifty pesetas." "I'll remember it myself," Bill said. I saw he was angry and wanted to smooth him down. "It's a sure thing they'll come," I said. "But maybe not to-night." "Want to call it off?" Cohn asked. "No. Why should I? Make it a hundred if you like." "All right. I'll take that." "That's enough," I said. "Or you'll have to make a book and give me some of it." "I'm satisfied," Cohn said. He smiled. "You'll probably win it back at bridge, anyway." "You haven't got it yet," Bill said. We went out to walk around under the arcade to the CafÃ© IruÃ±a for coffee. Cohn said he was going over and get a shave. "Say," Bill said to me, "have I got any chance on that bet?" "You've got a rotten chance. They've never been on time anywhere. If their money doesn't come it's a cinch they won't get in to-night." "I was sorry as soon as I opened my mouth. But I had to call him. He's all right, I guess, but where does he get this inside stuff? Mike and Brett fixed it up with us about coming down here." I saw Cohn coming over across the square. "Here he comes." "Well, let him not get superior and Jewish." "The barber shop's closed," Cohn said. "It's not open till four." We had coffee at the IruÃ±a, sitting in comfortable wicker chairs looking out from the cool of the arcade at the big square. After a while Bill went to write some letters and Cohn went over to the barber-shop. It was still closed, so he decided to go up to the hotel and get a bath, and I sat out in front of the cafÃ© and then went for a walk in the town. It was very hot, but I kept on the shady side of the streets and went through the market and had a good time seeing the town again. I went to the Ayuntamiento and found the old gentleman who subscribes for the bull-fight tickets for me every year, and he had gotten the money I sent him from Paris and renewed my subscriptions, so that was all set. He was the archivist, and all the archives of the town were in his office. That has nothing to do with the story. Anyway, his office had a green baize door and a big wooden door, and when I went out I left him sitting among the archives that covered all the walls, and I shut both the doors, and as I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to brush off my coat. "You must have been in a motor-car," he said. The back of the collar and the upper part of the shoulders were gray with dust. "From Bayonne." "Well, well," he said. "I knew you were in a motor-car from the way the dust was." So I gave him two copper coins. At the end of the street I saw the cathedral and walked up toward it. The first time I ever saw it I thought the faÃ§ade was ugly but I liked it now. I went inside. It was dim and dark and the pillars went high up, and there were people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were some wonderful big windows. I knelt and started to pray and prayed for everybody I thought of, Brett and Mike and Bill and Robert Cohn and myself, and all the bull-fighters, separately for the ones I liked, and lumping all the rest, then I prayed for myself again, and while I was praying for myself I found I was getting sleepy, so I prayed that the bull-fights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta, and that we would get some fishing. I wondered if there was anything else I might pray for, and I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed that I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I would make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count, and I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn't seen him since that night in Montmartre, and about something funny Brett told me about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the wood in front of me, and was thinking of myself as praying, I was a little ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but realized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while, and maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only wished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time; and then I was out in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers and the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in the sun. The sunlight was hot and hard, and I crossed over beside some buildings, and walked back along side-streets to the hotel. At dinner that night we found that Robert Cohn had taken a bath, had had a shave and a haircut and a shampoo, and something put on his hair afterward to make it stay down. He was nervous, and I did not try to help him any. The train was due in at nine o'clock from San Sebastian, and, if Brett and Mike were coming, they would be on it. At twenty minutes to nine we were not half through dinner. Robert Cohn got up from the table and said he would go to the station. I said I would go with him, just to devil him. Bill said he would be damned if he would leave his dinner. I said we would be right back. We walked to the station. I was enjoying Cohn's nervousness. I hoped Brett would be on the train. At the station the train was late, and we sat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark. I have never seen a man in civil life as nervous as Robert Cohn--nor as eager. I was enjoying it. It was lousy to enjoy it, but I felt lousy. Cohn had a wonderful quality of bringing out the worst in anybody. After a while we heard the train-whistle way off below on the other side of the plateau, and then we saw the headlight coming up the hill. We went inside the station and stood with a crowd of people just back of the gates, and the train came in and stopped, and everybody started coming out through the gates. They were not in the crowd. We waited till everybody had gone through and out of the station and gotten into buses, or taken cabs, or were walking with their friends or relatives through the dark into the town. "I knew they wouldn't come," Robert said. We were going back to the hotel. "I thought they might," I said. Bill was eating fruit when we came in and finishing a bottle of wine. "Didn't come, eh?" "No." "Do you mind if I give you that hundred pesetas in the morning, Cohn?" Bill asked. "I haven't changed any money here yet." "Oh, forget about it," Robert Cohn said. "Let's bet on something else. Can you bet on bull-fights?" "You could," Bill said, "but you don't need to." "It would be like betting on the war," I said. "You don't need any economic interest." "I'm very curious to see them," Robert said. Montoya came up to our table. He had a telegram in his hand. "It's for you." He handed it to me. It read: "Stopped night San Sebastian." "It's from them," I said. I put it in my pocket. Ordinarily I should have handed it over. "They've stopped over in San Sebastian," I said. "Send their regards to you." Why I felt that impulse to devil him I do not know. Of course I do know. I was blind, unforgivingly jealous of what had happened to him. The fact that I took it as a matter of course did not alter that any. I certainly did hate him. I do not think I ever really hated him until he had that little spell of superiority at lunch--that and when he went through all that barbering. So I put the telegram in my pocket. The telegram came to me, anyway. "Well," I said. "We ought to pull out on the noon bus for Burguete. They can follow us if they get in to-morrow night." There were only two trains up from San Sebastian, an early morning train and the one we had just met. "That sounds like a good idea," Cohn said. "The sooner we get on the stream the better." "It's all one to me when we start," Bill said. "The sooner the better." We sat in the IruÃ±a for a while and had coffee and then took a little walk out to the bull-ring and across the field and under the trees at the edge of the cliff and looked down at the river in the dark, and I turned in early. Bill and Cohn stayed out in the cafÃ© quite late, I believe, because I was asleep when they came in. In the morning I bought three tickets for the bus to Burguete. It was scheduled to leave at two o'clock. There was nothing earlier. I was sitting over at the IruÃ±a reading the papers when I saw Robert Cohn coming across the square. He came up to the table and sat down in one of the wicker chairs. "This is a comfortable cafÃ©," he said. "Did you have a good night, Jake?" "I slept like a log." "I didn't sleep very well. Bill and I were out late, too." "Where were you?" "Here. And after it shut we went over to that other cafÃ©. The old man there speaks German and English." "The CafÃ© Suizo." "That's it. He seems like a nice old fellow. I think it's a better cafÃ© than this one." "It's not so good in the daytime," I said. "Too hot. By the way, I got the bus tickets." "I'm not going up to-day. You and Bill go on ahead." "I've got your ticket." "Give it to me. I'll get the money back." "It's five pesetas." Robert Cohn took out a silver five-peseta piece and gave it to me. "I ought to stay," he said. "You see I'm afraid there's some sort of misunderstanding." "Why," I said. "They may not come here for three or four days now if they start on parties at San Sebastian." "That's just it," said Robert. "I'm afraid they expected to meet me at San Sebastian, and that's why they stopped over." "What makes you think that?" "Well, I wrote suggesting it to Brett." "Why in hell didn't you stay there and meet them then?" I started to say, but I stopped. I thought that idea would come to him by itself, but I do not believe it ever did. He was being confidential now and it was giving him pleasure to be able to talk with the understanding that I knew there was something between him and Brett. "Well, Bill and I will go up right after lunch," I said. "I wish I could go. We've been looking forward to this fishing all winter." He was being sentimental about it. "But I ought to stay. I really ought. As soon as they come I'll bring them right up." "Let's find Bill." "I want to go over to the barber-shop." "See you at lunch." I found Bill up in his room. He was shaving. "Oh, yes, he told me all about it last night," Bill said. "He's a great little confider. He said he had a date with Brett at San Sebastian." "The lying bastard!" "Oh, no," said Bill. "Don't get sore. Don't get sore at this stage of the trip. How did you ever happen to know this fellow, anyway?" "Don't rub it in." Bill looked around, half-shaved, and then went on talking into the mirror while he lathered his face. "Didn't you send him with a letter to me in New York last winter? Thank God, I'm a travelling man. Haven't you got some more Jewish friends you could bring along?" He rubbed his chin with his thumb, looked at it, and then started scraping again. "You've got some fine ones yourself." "Oh, yes. I've got some darbs. But not alongside of this Robert Cohn. The funny thing is he's nice, too. I like him. But he's just so awful." "He can be damn nice." "I know it. That's the terrible part." I laughed. "Yes. Go on and laugh," said Bill. "You weren't out with him last night until two o'clock." "Was he very bad?" "Awful. What's all this about him and Brett, anyway? Did she ever have anything to do with him?" He raised his chin up and pulled it from side to side. "Sure. She went down to San Sebastian with him." "What a damn-fool thing to do. Why did she do that?" "She wanted to get out of town and she can't go anywhere alone. She said she thought it would be good for him." "What bloody-fool things people do. Why didn't she go off with some of her own people? Or you?"--he slurred that over--"or me? Why not me?" He looked at his face carefully in the glass, put a big dab of lather on each cheek-bone. "It's an honest face. It's a face any woman would be safe with." "She'd never seen it." "She should have. All women should see it. It's a face that ought to be thrown on every screen in the country. Every woman ought to be given a copy of this face as she leaves the altar. Mothers should tell their daughters about this face. My son"--he pointed the razor at me--"go west with this face and grow up with the country." He ducked down to the bowl, rinsed his face with cold water, put on some alcohol, and then looked at himself carefully in the glass, pulling down his long upper lip. "My God!" he said, "isn't it an awful face?" He looked in the glass. "And as for this Robert Cohn," Bill said, "he makes me sick, and he can go to hell, and I'm damn glad he's staying here so we won't have him fishing with us." "You're damn right." "We're going trout-fishing. We're going trout-fishing in the Irati River, and we're going to get tight now at lunch on the wine of the country, and then take a swell bus ride." "Come on. Let's go over to the IruÃ±a and start," I said. CHAPTER 11 It was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our bags and the rod-case to go to Burguete. People were on top of the bus, and others were climbing up a ladder. Bill went up and Robert sat beside Bill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a couple of bottles of wine to take with us. When I came out the bus was crowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top, and the women all had their fans going in the sun. It certainly was hot. Robert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top. Robert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us start. A Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. He offered the wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. He apologized and made me take another drink. He made the klaxon again a little later, and it fooled me the second time. He was very good at it. The Basques liked it. The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. The man waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch. When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. Every one took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it away. They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They were peasants going up into the hills. Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert Cohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him. As soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt nice riding high up and close under the trees. The bus went quite fast and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. The Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the wine-bottle, and winked at us. He nodded his head. "Pretty nice, eh?" "These Basques are swell people," Bill said. The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle-leather. He wore a black smock like all the rest. There were wrinkles in his tanned neck. He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill. Bill handed him one of our bottles. The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and handed the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand. He shoved the wine-bag up. "Arriba! Arriba!" he said. "Lift it up." Bill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into his mouth, his head tipped back. When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin. "No! No!" several Basques said. "Not like that." One snatched the bottle away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. He was a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms' length and raised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream of wine hissed into his mouth. He held the bag out there, the wine making a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing smoothly and regularly. "Hey!" the owner of the bottle shouted. "Whose wine is that?" The drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his eyes. Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the wine-bag and lowered it down to the owner. He winked at us. The owner shook the wine-skin sadly. We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the driver took on several packages. Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain. The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose under the wheels and hung in the air behind us. The road climbed up into the hills and left the rich grain-fields below. Now there were only patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the water-courses. We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. The wagon and the mules were covered with dust. Close behind was another string of mules and another wagon. This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we passed. Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain. We came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a sudden green valley. A stream went through the centre of the town and fields of grapes touched the houses. The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under the big tarpaulins and lifted down. Bill and I got down and went into the posada. There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and hay-forks made of white wood, and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes and hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging from the roof. It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long wooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks. Behind them were shelves stacked with supplies and goods. We each had an aguardiente and paid forty centimes for the two drinks. I gave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the copper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price. Two of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink. So they bought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on the back and bought another drink. Then we bought, and then we all went out into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus. There was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the Basque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us. The woman who had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and talked to somebody inside the bus. Then the driver came out swinging two flat leather mail-pouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we started off. The road left the green valley at once, and we were up in the hills again. Bill and the wine-bottle Basque were having a conversation. A man leaned over from the other side of the seat and asked in English: "You're Americans?" "Sure." "I been there," he said. "Forty years ago." He was an old man, as brown as the others, with the stubble of a white beard. "How was it?" "What you say?" "How was America?" "Oh, I was in California. It was fine." "Why did you leave?" "What you say?" "Why did you come back here?" "Oh! I come back to get married. I was going to go back but my wife she don't like to travel. Where you from?" "Kansas City." "I been there," he said. "I been in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City." He named them carefully. "How long were you over?" "Fifteen years. Then I come back and got married." "Have a drink?" "All right," he said. "You can't get this in America, eh?" "There's plenty if you can pay for it." "What you come over here for?" "We're going to the fiesta at Pamplona." "You like the bull-fights?" "Sure. Don't you?" "Yes," he said. "I guess I like them." Then after a little: "Where you go now?" "Up to Burguete to fish." "Well," he said, "I hope you catch something." He shook hands and turned around to the back seat again. The other Basques had been impressed. He sat back comfortably and smiled at me when I turned around to look at the country. But the effort of talking American seemed to have tired him. He did not say anything after that. The bus climbed steadily up the road. The country was barren and rocks stuck up through the clay. There was no grass beside the road. Looking back we could see the country spread out below. Far back the fields were squares of green and brown on the hillsides. Making the horizon were the brown mountains. They were strangely shaped. As we climbed higher the horizon kept changing. As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see other mountains coming up in the south. Then the road came over the crest, flattened out, and went into a forest. It was a forest of cork oaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were cattle grazing back in the trees. We went through the forest and the road came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a rolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it. These were not like the brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind. These were wooded and there were clouds coming down from them. The green plain stretched off. It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the trunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the north. As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white houses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain, and away off on the shoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of the monastery of Roncesvalles. "There's Roncevaux," I said. "Where?" "Way off there where the mountain starts." "It's cold up here," Bill said. "It's high," I said. "It must be twelve hundred metres." "It's awful cold," Bill said. The bus levelled down onto the straight line of road that ran to Burguete. We passed a crossroads and crossed a bridge over a stream. The houses of Burguete were along both sides of the road. There were no side-streets. We passed the church and the school-yard, and the bus stopped. We got down and the driver handed down our bags and the rod-case. A carabineer in his cocked hat and yellow leather cross-straps came up. "What's in there?" he pointed to the rod-case. I opened it and showed him. He asked to see our fishing permits and I got them out. He looked at the date and then waved us on. "Is that all right?" I asked. "Yes. Of course." We went up the street, past the whitewashed stone houses, families sitting in their doorways watching us, to the inn. The fat woman who ran the inn came out from the kitchen and shook hands with us. She took off her spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again. It was cold in the inn and the wind was starting to blow outside. The woman sent a girl up-stairs with us to show the room. There were two beds, a washstand, a clothes-chest, and a big, framed steel-engraving of Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Roncesvalles. The wind was blowing against the shutters. The room was on the north side of the inn. We washed, put on sweaters, and came down-stairs into the dining-room. It had a stone floor, low ceiling, and was oak-panelled. The shutters were up and it was so cold you could see your breath. "My God!" said Bill. "It can't be this cold to-morrow. I'm not going to wade a stream in this weather." There was an upright piano in the far corner of the room beyond the wooden tables and Bill went over and started to play. "I got to keep warm," he said. I went out to find the woman and ask her how much the room and board was. She put her hands under her apron and looked away from me. "Twelve pesetas." "Why, we only paid that in Pamplona." She did not say anything, just took off her glasses and wiped them on her apron. "That's too much," I said. "We didn't pay more than that at a big hotel." "We've put in a bathroom." "Haven't you got anything cheaper?" "Not in the summer. Now is the big season." We were the only people in the inn. Well, I thought, it's only a few days. "Is the wine included?" "Oh, yes." "Well," I said. "It's all right." I went back to Bill. He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was, and went on playing. I sat at one of the tables and looked at the pictures on the wall. There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of pheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks. The panels were all dark and smoky-looking. There was a cupboard full of liqueur bottles. I looked at them all. Bill was still playing. "How about a hot rum punch?" he said. "This isn't going to keep me warm permanently." I went out and told the woman what a rum punch was and how to make it. In a few minutes a girl brought a stone pitcher, steaming, into the room. Bill came over from the piano and we drank the hot punch and listened to the wind. "There isn't too much rum in that." I went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a half-tumblerful into the pitcher. "Direct action," said Bill. "It beats legislation." The girl came in and laid the table for supper. "It blows like hell up here," Bill said. The girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine. We had fried trout afterward and some sort of a stew and a big bowl full of wild strawberries. We did not lose money on the wine, and the girl was shy but nice about bringing it The old woman looked in once and counted the empty bottles. After supper we went up-stairs and smoked and read in bed to keep warm. Once in the night I woke and heard the wind blowing. It felt good to be warm and in bed. CHAPTER 12 When I woke in the morning I went to the window and looked out. It had cleared and there were no clouds on the mountains. Outside under the window were some carts and an old diligence, the wood of the roof cracked and split by the weather. It must have been left from the days before the motor-buses. A goat hopped up on one of the carts and then to the roof of the diligence. He jerked his head at the other goats below and when I waved at him he bounded down. Bill was still sleeping, so I dressed, put on my shoes outside in the hall, and went down-stairs. No one was stirring down-stairs, so I unbolted the door and went out. It was cool outside in the early morning and the sun had not yet dried the dew that had come when the wind died down. I hunted around in the shed behind the inn and found a sort of mattock, and went down toward the stream to try and dig some worms for bait. The stream was clear and shallow but it did not look trouty. On the grassy bank where it was damp I drove the mattock into the earth and loosened a chunk of sod. There were worms underneath. They slid out of sight as I lifted the sod and I dug carefully and got a good many. Digging at the edge of the damp ground I filled two empty tobacco-tins with worms and sifted dirt onto them. The goats watched me dig. When I went back into the inn the woman was down in the kitchen, and I asked her to get coffee for us, and that we wanted a lunch. Bill was awake and sitting on the edge of the bed. "I saw you out of the window," he said. "Didn't want to interrupt you. What were you doing? Burying your money?" "You lazy bum!" "Been working for the common good? Splendid. I want you to do that every morning." "Come on," I said. "Get up." "What? Get up? I never get up." He climbed into bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin. "Try and argue me into getting up." I went on looking for the tackle and putting it all together in the tackle-bag. "Aren't you interested?" Bill asked. "I'm going down and eat." "Eat? Why didn't you say eat? I thought you just wanted me to get up for fun. Eat? Fine. Now you're reasonable. You go out and dig some more worms and I'll be right down." "Oh, go to hell!" "Work for the good of all." Bill stepped into his underclothes. "Show irony and pity." I started out of the room with the tackle-bag, the nets, and the rod-case. "Hey! come back!" I put my head in the door. "Aren't you going to show a little irony and pity?" I thumbed my nose. "That's not irony." As I went down-stairs I heard Bill singing, "Irony and Pity. When you're feeling ... Oh, Give them Irony and Give them Pity. Oh, give them Irony. When they're feeling ... Just a little irony. Just a little pity ..." He kept on singing until he came down-stairs. The tune was: "The Bells are Ringing for Me and my Gal." I was reading a week-old Spanish paper. "What's all this irony and pity?" "What? Don't you know about Irony and Pity?" "No. Who got it up?" "Everybody. They're mad about it in New York. It's just like the Fratellinis used to be." The girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was bread toasted and buttered. "Ask her if she's got any jam," Bill said. "Be ironical with her." "Have you got any jam?" "That's not ironical. I wish I could talk Spanish." The coffee was good and we drank it out of big bowls. The girl brought in a glass dish of raspberry jam. "Thank you." "Hey! that's not the way," Bill said. "Say something ironical. Make some crack about Primo de Rivera." "I could ask her what kind of a jam they think they've gotten into in the Riff." "Poor," said Bill. "Very poor. You can't do it. That's all. You don't understand irony. You have no pity. Say something pitiful." "Robert Cohn." "Not so bad. That's better. Now why is Cohn pitiful? Be ironic." He took a big gulp of coffee. "Aw, hell!" I said. "It's too early in the morning." "There you go. And you claim you want to be a writer, too. You're only a newspaper man. An expatriated newspaper man. You ought to be ironical the minute you get out of bed. You ought to wake up with your mouth full of pity." "Go on," I said. "Who did you get this stuff from?" "Everybody. Don't you read? Don't you ever see anybody? You know what you are? You're an expatriate. Why don't you live in New York? Then you'd know these things. What do you want me to do? Come over here and tell you every year?" "Take some more coffee," I said. "Good. Coffee is good for you. It's the caffeine in it. Caffeine, we are here. Caffeine puts a man on her horse and a woman in his grave. You know what's the trouble with you? You're an expatriate. One of the worst type. Haven't you heard that? Nobody that ever left their own country ever wrote anything worth printing. Not even in the newspapers." He drank the coffee. "You're an expatriate. You've lost touch with the soil. You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafÃ©s." "It sounds like a swell life," I said. "When do I work?" "You don't work. One group claims women support you. Another group claims you're impotent." "No," I said. "I just had an accident." "Never mention that," Bill said. "That's the sort of thing that can't be spoken of. That's what you ought to work up into a mystery. Like Henry's bicycle." He had been going splendidly, but he stopped. I was afraid he thought he had hurt me with that crack about being impotent. I wanted to start him again. "It wasn't a bicycle," I said. "He was riding horseback." "I heard it was a tricycle." "Well," I said. "A plane is sort of like a tricycle. The joystick works the same way." "But you don't pedal it." "No," I said, "I guess you don't pedal it." "Let's lay off that," Bill said. "All right. I was just standing up for the tricycle." "I think he's a good writer, too," Bill said. "And you're a hell of a good guy. Anybody ever tell you you were a good guy?" "I'm not a good guy." "Listen. You're a hell of a good guy, and I'm fonder of you than anybody on earth. I couldn't tell you that in New York. It'd mean I was a faggot. That was what the Civil War was about. Abraham Lincoln was a faggot. He was in love with General Grant. So was Jefferson Davis. Lincoln just freed the slaves on a bet. The Dred Scott case was framed by the Anti-Saloon League. Sex explains it all. The Colonel's Lady and Judy O'Grady are Lesbians under their skin." He stopped. "Want to hear some more?" "Shoot," I said. "I don't know any more. Tell you some more at lunch." "Old Bill," I said. "You bum!" We packed the lunch and two bottles of wine in the rucksack, and Bill put it on. I carried the rod-case and the landing-nets slung over my back. We started up the road and then went across a meadow and found a path that crossed the fields and went toward the woods on the slope of the first hill. We walked across the fields on the sandy path. The fields were rolling and grassy and the grass was short from the sheep grazing. The cattle were up in the hills. We heard their bells in the woods. The path crossed a stream on a foot-log. The log was surfaced off, and there was a sapling bent across for a rail. In the flat pool beside the stream tadpoles spotted the sand. We went up a steep bank and across the rolling fields. Looking back we saw Burguete, white houses and red roofs, and the white road with a truck going along it and the dust rising. Beyond the fields we crossed another faster-flowing stream. A sandy road led down to the ford and beyond into the woods. The path crossed the stream on another foot-log below the ford, and joined the road, and we went into the woods. It was a beech wood and the trees were very old. Their roots bulked above the ground and the branches were twisted. We walked on the road between the thick trunks of the old beeches and the sunlight came through the leaves in light patches on the grass. The trees were big, and the foliage was thick but it was not gloomy. There was no undergrowth, only the smooth grass, very green and fresh, and the big gray trees well spaced as though it were a park. "This is country," Bill said. The road went up a hill and we got into thick woods, and the road kept on climbing. Sometimes it dipped down but rose again steeply. All the time we heard the cattle in the woods. Finally, the road came out on the top of the hills. We were on the top of the height of land that was the highest part of the range of wooded hills we had seen from Burguete. There were wild strawberries growing on the sunny side of the ridge in a little clearing in the trees. Ahead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the ridge of hills. The hills ahead were not wooded, and there were great fields of yellow gorse. Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees and jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River. "We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley," I pointed out to Bill. "That's a hell of a hike." "It's too far to go and fish and come back the same day, comfortably." "Comfortably. That's a nice word. We'll have to go like hell to get there and back and have any fishing at all." It was a long walk and the country was very fine, but we were tired when we came down the steep road that led out of the wooded hills into the valley of the Rio de la Fabrica. The road came out from the shadow of the woods into the hot sun. Ahead was a river-valley. Beyond the river was a steep hill. There was a field of buckwheat on the hill. We saw a white house under some trees on the hillside. It was very hot and we stopped under some trees beside a dam that crossed the river. Bill put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods, put on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish. "You're sure this thing has trout in it?" Bill asked. "It's full of them." "I'm going to fish a fly. You got any McGintys?" "There's some in there." "You going to fish bait?" "Yeah. I'm going to fish the dam here." "Well, I'll take the fly-book, then." He tied on a fly. "Where'd I better go? Up or down?" "Down is the best. They're plenty up above, too." Bill went down the bank. "Take a worm can." "No, I don't want one. If they won't take a fly I'll just flick it around." Bill was down below watching the stream. "Say," he called up against the noise of the dam. "How about putting the wine in that spring up the road?" "All right," I shouted. Bill waved his hand and started down the stream. I found the two wine-bottles in the pack, and carried them up the road to where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe. There was a board over the spring and I lifted it and, knocking the corks firmly into the bottles, lowered them down into the water. It was so cold my hand and wrist felt numbed. I put back the slab of wood, and hoped nobody would find the wine. I got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the bait-can and landing-net, and walked out onto the dam. It was built to provide a head of water for driving logs. The gate was up, and I sat on one of the squared timbers and watched the smooth apron of water before the river tumbled into the falls. In the white water at the foot of the dam it was deep. As I baited up, a trout shot up out of the white water into the falls and was carried down. Before I could finish baiting, another trout jumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into the water that was thundering down. I put on a good-sized sinker and dropped into the white water close to the edge of the timbers of the dam. I did not feel the first trout strike. When I started to pull up I felt that I had one and brought him, fighting and bending the rod almost double, out of the boiling water at the foot of the falls, and swung him up and onto the dam. He was a good trout, and I banged his head against the timber so that he quivered out straight, and then slipped him into my bag. While I had him on, several trout had jumped at the falls. As soon as I baited up and dropped in again I hooked another and brought him in the same way. In a little while I had six. They were all about the same size. I laid them out, side by side, all their heads pointing the same way, and looked at them. They were beautifully colored and firm and hard from the cold water. It was a hot day, so I slit them all and shucked out the insides, gills and all, and tossed them over across the river. I took the trout ashore, washed them in the cold, smoothly heavy water above the dam, and then picked some ferns and packed them all in the bag, three trout on a layer of ferns, then another layer of fems, then three more trout, and then covered them with ferns. They looked nice in the ferns, and now the bag was bulky, and I put it in the shade of the tree. It was very hot on the dam, so I put my worm-can in the shade with the bag, and got a book out of the pack and settled down under the tree to read until Bill should come up for lunch. It was a little past noon and there was not much shade, but I sat against the trunk of two of the trees that grew together, and read. The book was something by A. E. W. Mason, and I was reading a wonderful story about a man who had been frozen in the Alps and then fallen into a glacier and disappeared, and his bride was going to wait twenty-four years exactly for his body to come out on the moraine, while her true love waited too, and they were still waiting when Bill came up. "Get any?" he asked. He had his rod and his bag and his net all in one hand, and he was sweating. I hadn't heard him come up, because of the noise from the dam. "Six. What did you get?" Bill sat down, opened up his bag, laid a big trout on the grass. He took out three more, each one a little bigger than the last, and laid them side by side in the shade from the tree. His face was sweaty and happy. "How are yours?" "Smaller." "Let's see them." "They're packed." "How big are they really?" "They're all about the size of your smallest." "You're not holding out on me?" "I wish I were." "Get them all on worms?" "Yes." "You lazy bum!" Bill put the trout in the bag and started for the river, swinging the open bag. He was wet from the waist down and I knew he must have been wading the stream. I walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine. They were cold. Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back to the trees. I spread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked one of the bottles and leaned the other against a tree. Bill came up drying his hands, his bag plump with ferns. "Let's see that bottle," he said. He pulled the cork, and tipped up the bottle and drank. "Whew! That makes my eyes ache." "Let's try it." The wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty. "That's not such filthy wine," Bill said. "The cold helps it," I said. We unwrapped the little parcels of lunch. "Chicken." "There's hard-boiled eggs." "Find any salt?" "First the egg," said Bill. "Then the chicken. Even Bryan could see that." "He's dead. I read it in the paper yesterday." "No. Not really?" "Yes. Bryan's dead." Bill laid down the egg he was peeling. "Gentlemen," he said, and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of newspaper. "I reverse the order. For Bryan's sake. As a tribute to the Great Commoner. First the chicken; then the egg." "Wonder what day God created the chicken?" "Oh," said Bill, sucking the drumstick, "how should we know? We should not question. Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks." "Eat an egg." Bill gestured with the drumstick in one hand and the bottle of wine in the other. "Let us rejoice in our blessings. Let us utilize the fowls of the air. Let us utilize the product of the vine. Will you utilize a little, brother?" "After you, brother." Bill took a long drink. "Utilize a little, brother," he handed me the bottle. "Let us not doubt, brother. Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hen-coop with simian fingers. Let us accept on faith and simply say--I want you to join with me in saying--What shall we say, brother?" He pointed the drumstick at me and went on. "Let me tell you. We will say, and I for one am proud to say--and I want you to say with me, on your knees, brother. Let no man be ashamed to kneel here in the great out-of-doors. Remember the woods were God's first temples. Let us kneel and say: 'Don't eat that, Lady--that's Mencken.'" "Here," I said. "Utilize a little of this." We uncorked the other bottle. "What's the matter?" I said. "Didn't you like Bryan?" "I loved Bryan," said Bill. "We were like brothers." "Where did you know him?" "He and Mencken and I all went to Holy Cross together." "And Frankie Fritsch." "It's a lie. Frankie Fritsch went to Fordham." "Well," I said, "I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning." "It's a lie," Bill said. "I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning myself." "You're cock-eyed," I said. "On wine?" "Why not?" "It's the humidity," Bill said. "They ought to take this damn humidity away." "Have another shot." "Is this all we've got?" "Only the two bottles." "Do you know what you are?" Bill looked at the bottle affectionately. "No," I said. "You're in the pay of the Anti-Saloon League." "I went to Notre Dame with Wayne B. Wheeler." "It's a lie," said Bill. "I went to Austin Business College with Wayne B. Wheeler. He was class president." "Well," I said, "the saloon must go." "You're right there, old classmate," Bill said. "The saloon must go, and I will take it with me." "You're cock-eyed." "On wine?" "On wine." "Well, maybe I am." "Want to take a nap?" "All right." We lay with our heads in the shade and looked up into the trees. "You asleep?" "No," Bill said. "I was thinking." I shut my eyes. It felt good lying on the ground. "Say," Bill said, "what about this Brett business?" "What about it?" "Were you ever in love with her?" "Sure." "For how long?" "Off and on for a hell of a long time." "Oh, hell!" Bill said. "I'm sorry, fella." "It's all right," I said. "I don't give a damn any more." "Really?" "Really. Only I'd a hell of a lot rather not talk about it." "You aren't sore I asked you?" "Why the hell should I be?" "I'm going to sleep," Bill said. He put a newspaper over his face. "Listen, Jake," he said, "are you really a Catholic?" "Technically." "What does that mean?" "I don't know." "All right, I'll go to sleep now," he said. "Don't keep me awake by talking so much." I went to sleep, too. When I woke up Bill was packing the rucksack. It was late in the afternoon and the shadow from the trees was long and went out over the dam. I was stiff from sleeping on the ground. "What did you do? Wake up?" Bill asked. "Why didn't you spend the night?" I stretched and rubbed my eyes. "I had a lovely dream," Bill said. "I don't remember what it was about, but it was a lovely dream." "I don't think I dreamt." "You ought to dream," Bill said. "All our biggest business men have been dreamers. Look at Ford. Look at President Coolidge. Look at Rockefeller. Look at Jo Davidson." I disjointed my rod and Bill's and packed them in the rod-case. I put the reels in the tackle-bag. Bill had packed the rucksack and we put one of the trout-bags in. I carried the other. "Well," said Bill, "have we got everything?" "The worms." "Your worms. Put them in there." He had the pack on his back and I put the worm-cans in one of the outside flap pockets. "You got everything now?" I looked around on the grass at the foot of the elm-trees. "Yes." We started up the road into the woods. It was a long walk home to Burguete, and it was dark when we came down across the fields to the road, and along the road between the houses of the town, their windows lighted, to the inn. We stayed five days at Burguete and had good fishing. The nights were cold and the days were hot, and there was always a breeze even in the heat of the day. It was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a cold stream, and the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the bank. We found a stream with a pool deep enough to swim in. In the evenings we played three-handed bridge with an Englishman named Harris, who had walked over from Saint Jean Pied de Port and was stopping at the inn for the fishing. He was very pleasant and went with us twice to the Irati River. There was no word from Robert Cohn nor from Brett and Mike. CHAPTER 13 One morning I went down to breakfast and the Englishman, Harris, was already at the table. He was reading the paper through spectacles. He looked up and smiled. "Good morning," he said. "Letter for you. I stopped at the post and they gave it me with mine." The letter was at my place at the table, leaning against a coffee-cup. Harris was reading the paper again. I opened the letter. It had been forwarded from Pamplona. It was dated San Sebastian, Sunday: DEAR JAKE, We got here Friday, Brett passed out on the train, so brought her here for 3 days rest with old friends of ours. We go to Montoya Hotel Pamplona Tuesday, arriving at I don't know what hour. Will you send a note by the bus to tell us what to do to rejoin you all on Wednesday. All our love and sorry to be late, but Brett was really done in and will be quite all right by Tues. and is practically so now. I know her so well and try to look after her but it's not so easy. Love to all the chaps, MICHAEL. "What day of the week is it?" I asked Harris. "Wednesday, I think. Yes, quite. Wednesday. Wonderful how one loses track of the days up here in the mountains." "Yes. We've been here nearly a week." "I hope you're not thinking of leaving?" "Yes. We'll go in on the afternoon bus, I'm afraid." "What a rotten business. I had hoped we'd all have another go at the Irati together." "We have to go into Pamplona. We're meeting people there." "What rotten luck for me. We've had a jolly time here at Burguete." "Come on in to Pamplona. We can play some bridge there, and there's going to be a damned fine fiesta." "I'd like to. Awfully nice of you to ask me. I'd best stop on here, though. I've not much more time to fish." "You want those big ones in the Irati." "I say, I do, you know. They're enormous trout there." "I'd like to try them once more." "Do. Stop over another day. Be a good chap." "We really have to get into town," I said. "What a pity." After breakfast Bill and I were sitting warming in the sun on a bench out in front of the inn and talking it over. I saw a girl coming up the road from the centre of the town. She stopped in front of us and took a telegram out of the leather wallet that hung against her skirt. "Por ustedes?" I looked at it. The address was: "Barnes, Burguete." "Yes. It's for us." She brought out a book for me to sign, and I gave her a couple of coppers. The telegram was in Spanish: "Vengo Jueves Cohn." I handed it to Bill. "What does the word Cohn mean?" he asked. "What a lousy telegram!" I said. "He could send ten words for the same price. 'I come Thursday.' That gives you a lot of dope, doesn't it?" "It gives you all the dope that's of interest to Cohn." "We're going in, anyway," I said. "There's no use trying to move Brett and Mike out here and back before the fiesta. Should we answer it?" "We might as well," said Bill. "There's no need for us to be snooty." We walked up to the post-office and asked for a telegraph blank. "What will we say?" Bill asked. "'Arriving to-night.' That's enough." We paid for the message and walked back to the inn. Harris was there and the three of us walked up to Roncesvalles. We went through the monastery. "It's a remarkable place," Harris said, when we came out. "But you know I'm not much on those sort of places." "Me either," Bill said. "It's a remarkable place, though," Harris said. "I wouldn't not have seen it. I'd been intending coming up each day." "It isn't the same as fishing, though, is it?" Bill asked. He liked Harris. "I say not." We were standing in front of the old chapel of the monastery. "Isn't that a pub across the way?" Harris asked. "Or do my eyes deceive me?" "It has the look of a pub," Bill said. "It looks to me like a pub," I said. "I say," said Harris, "let's utilize it." He had taken up utilizing from Bill. We had a bottle of wine apiece. Harris would not let us pay. He talked Spanish quite well, and the innkeeper would not take our money. "I say. You don't know what it's meant to me to have you chaps up here." "We've had a grand time, Harris." Harris was a little tight. "I say. Really you don't know how much it means. I've not had much fun since the war." "We'll fish together again, some time. Don't you forget it, Harris." "We must. We have had such a jolly good time." "How about another bottle around?" "Jolly good idea," said Harris. "This is mine," said Bill. "Or we don't drink it." "I wish you'd let me pay for it. It does give me pleasure, you know." "This is going to give me pleasure," Bill said. The innkeeper brought in the fourth bottle. We had kept the same glasses. Harris lifted his glass. "I say. You know this does utilize well." Bill slapped him on the back. "Good old Harris." "I say. You know my name isn't really Harris. It's Wilson-Harris. All one name. With a hyphen, you know." "Good old Wilson-Harris," Bill said. "We call you Harris because we're so fond of you." "I say, Barnes. You don't know what this all means to me." "Come on and utilize another glass," I said. "Barnes. Really, Barnes, you can't know. That's all." "Drink up, Harris." We walked back down the road from Roncesvalles with Harris between us. We had lunch at the inn and Harris went with us to the bus. He gave us his card, with his address in London and his club and his business address, and as we got on the bus he handed us each an envelope. I opened mine and there were a dozen flies in it. Harris had tied them himself. He tied all his own flies. "I say, Harris--" I began. "No, no!" he said. He was climbing down from the bus. "They're not first-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it might remind you of what a good time we had." The bus started. Harris stood in front of the post-office. He waved. As we started along the road he turned and walked back toward the inn. "Say, wasn't that Harris nice?" Bill said. "I think he really did have a good time." "Harris? You bet he did." "I wish he'd come into Pamplona." "He wanted to fish." "Yes. You couldn't tell how English would mix with each other, anyway." "I suppose not." We got into Pamplona late in the afternoon and the bus stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya. Out in the plaza they were stringing electric-light wires to light the plaza for the fiesta. A few kids came up when the bus stopped, and a customs officer for the town made all the people getting down from the bus open their bundles on the sidewalk. We went into the hotel and on the stairs I met Montoya. He shook hands with us, smiling in his embarrassed way. "Your friends are here," he said. "Mr. Campbell?" "Yes. Mr. Cohn and Mr. Campbell and Lady Ashley." He smiled as though there were something I would hear about. "When did they get in?" "Yesterday. I've saved you the rooms you had." "That's fine. Did you give Mr. Campbell the room on the plaza?" "Yes. All the rooms we looked at." "Where are our friends now?" "I think they went to the pelota." "And how about the bulls?" Montoya smiled. "To-night," he said. "To-night at seven o'clock they bring in the Villar bulls, and to-morrow come the Miuras. Do you all go down?" "Oh, yes. They've never seen a desencajonada." Montoya put his hand on my shoulder. "I'll see you there." He smiled again. He always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very special secret between the two of us; a rather shocking but really very deep secret that we knew about. He always smiled as though there were something lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something that we understood. It would not do to expose it to people who would not understand. "Your friend, is he aficionado, too?" Montoya smiled at Bill. "Yes. He came all the way from New York to see the San Fermines." "Yes?" Montoya politely disbelieved. "But he's not aficionado like you." He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly. "Yes," I said. "He's a real aficionado." "But he's not aficionado like you are." Aficion means passion. An aficionado is one who is passionate about the bull-fights. All the good bull-fighters stayed at Montoya's hotel; that is, those with aficion stayed there. The commercial bull-fighters stayed once, perhaps, and then did not come back. The good ones came each year. In Montoya's room were their photographs. The photographs were dedicated to Juanito Montoya or to his sister. The photographs of bull-fighters Montoya had really believed in were framed. Photographs of bull-fighters who had been without aficion Montoya kept in a drawer of his desk. They often had the most flattering inscriptions. But they did not mean anything. One day Montoya took them all out and dropped them in the waste-basket. He did not want them around. We often talked about bulls and bull-fighters. I had stopped at the Montoya for several years. We never talked for very long at a time. It was simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt. Men would come in from distant towns and before they left Pamplona stop and talk for a few minutes with Montoya about bulls. These men were aficionados. Those who were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was full. Montoya introduced me to some of them. They were always very polite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an American. Somehow it was taken for granted that an American could not have aficion. He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he could not really have it. When they saw that I had aficion, and there was no password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was a sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions always a little on the defensive and never apparent, there was this same embarrassed putting the hand on the shoulder, or a "Buen hombre." But nearly always there was the actual touching. It seemed as though they wanted to touch you to make it certain. Montoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion. He could forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all sorts of lapses. For one who had aficion he could forgive anything. At once he forgave me all my friends. Without his ever saying anything they were simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling open of the horses in bull-fighting. Bill had gone up-stairs as we came in, and I found him washing and changing in his room. "Well," he said, "talk a lot of Spanish?" "He was telling me about the bulls coming in to-night." "Let's find the gang and go down." "All right. They'll probably be at the cafÃ©." "Have you got tickets?" "Yes. I got them for all the unloadings." "What's it like?" He was pulling his cheek before the glass, looking to see if there were unshaved patches under the line of the jaw. "It's pretty good," I said. "They let the bulls out of the cages one at a time, and they have steers in the corral to receive them and keep them from fighting, and the bulls tear in at the steers and the steers run around like old maids trying to quiet them down." "Do they ever gore the steers?" "Sure. Sometimes they go right after them and kill them." "Can't the steers do anything?" "No. They're trying to make friends." "What do they have them in for?" "To quiet down the bulls and keep them from breaking horns against the stone walls, or goring each other." "Must be swell being a steer." We went down the stairs and out of the door and walked across the square toward the CafÃ© IruÃ±a. There were two lonely looking ticket-houses standing in the square. Their windows, marked SOL, SOL Y SOMBRA, and SOMBRA, were shut. They would not open until the day before the fiesta. Across the square the white wicker tables and chairs of the IruÃ±a extended out beyond the Arcade to the edge of the street. I looked for Brett and Mike at the tables. There they were. Brett and Mike and Robert Cohn. Brett was wearing a Basque beret. So was Mike. Robert Cohn was bare-headed and wearing his spectacles. Brett saw us coming and waved. Her eyes crinkled up as we came up to the table. "Hello, you chaps!" she called. Brett was happy. Mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into shaking hands. Robert Cohn shook hands because we were back. "Where the hell have you been?" I asked. "I brought them up here," Cohn said. "What rot," Brett said. "We'd have gotten here earlier if you hadn't come." "You'd never have gotten here." "What rot! You chaps are brown. Look at Bill." "Did you get good fishing?" Mike asked. "We wanted to join you." "It wasn't bad. We missed you." "I wanted to come," Cohn said, "but I thought I ought to bring them." "You bring us. What rot." "Was it really good?" Mike asked. "Did you take many?" "Some days we took a dozen apiece. There was an Englishman up there." "Named Harris," Bill said. "Ever know him, Mike? He was in the war, too." "Fortunate fellow," Mike said. "What times we had. How I wish those dear days were back." "Don't be an ass." "Were you in the war, Mike?" Cohn asked. "Was I not." "He was a very distinguished soldier," Brett said. "Tell them about the time your horse bolted down Piccadilly." "I'll not. I've told that four times." "You never told me," Robert Cohn said. "I'll not tell that story. It reflects discredit on me." "Tell them about your medals." "I'll not. That story reflects great discredit on me." "What story's that?" "Brett will tell you. She tells all the stories that reflect discredit on me." "Go on. Tell it, Brett." "Should I?" "I'll tell it myself." "What medals have you got, Mike?" "I haven't got any medals." "You must have some." "I suppose I've the usual medals. But I never sent in for them. One time there was this wopping big dinner and the Prince of Wales was to be there, and the cards said medals will be worn. So naturally I had no medals, and I stopped at my tailor's and he was impressed by the invitation, and I thought that's a good piece of business, and I said to him: 'You've got to fix me up with some medals.' He said: 'What medals, sir?' And I said: 'Oh, any medals. Just give me a few medals.' So he said: 'What medals have you, sir?' And I said: 'How should I know?' Did he think I spent all my time reading the bloody gazette? 'Just give me a good lot. Pick them out yourself.' So he got me some medals, you know, miniature medals, and handed me the box, and I put it in my pocket and forgot it. Well, I went to the dinner, and it was the night they'd shot Henry Wilson, so the Prince didn't come and the King didn't come, and no one wore any medals, and all these coves were busy taking off their medals, and I had mine in my pocket." He stopped for us to laugh. "Is that all?" "That's all. Perhaps I didn't tell it right." "You didn't," said Brett. "But no matter." We were all laughing. "Ah, yes," said Mike. "I know now. It was a damn dull dinner, and I couldn't stick it, so I left. Later on in the evening I found the box in my pocket. What's this? I said. Medals? Bloody military medals? So I cut them all off their backing--you know, they put them on a strip--and gave them all around. Gave one to each girl. Form of souvenir. They thought I was hell's own shakes of a soldier. Give away medals in a night club. Dashing fellow." "Tell the rest," Brett said. "Don't you think that was funny?" Mike asked. We were all laughing. "It was. I swear it was. Any rate, my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals back. Sent a man around. Kept on writing for months. Seems some chap had left them to be cleaned. Frightfully military cove. Set hell's own store by them." Mike paused. "Rotten luck for the tailor," he said. "You don't mean it," Bill said. "I should think it would have been grand for the tailor." "Frightfully good tailor. Never believe it to see me now," Mike said. "I used to pay him a hundred pounds a year just to keep him quiet. So he wouldn't send me any bills. Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt. It was right after the medals. Gave his letters rather a bitter tone." "How did you go bankrupt?" Bill asked. "Two ways," Mike said. "Gradually and then suddenly." "What brought it on?" "Friends," said Mike. "I had a lot of friends. False friends. Then I had creditors, too. Probably had more creditors than anybody in England." "Tell them about in the court," Brett said. "I don't remember," Mike said. "I was just a little tight." "Tight!" Brett exclaimed. "You were blind!" "Extraordinary thing," Mike said. "Met my former partner the other day. Offered to buy me a drink." "Tell them about your learned counsel," Brett said. "I will not," Mike said. "My learned counsel was blind, too. I say this is a gloomy subject. Are we going down and see these bulls unloaded or not?" "Let's go down." We called the waiter, paid, and started to walk through the town. I started off walking with Brett, but Robert Cohn came up and joined her on the other side. The three of us walked along, past the Ayuntamiento with the banners hung from the balcony, down past the market and down past the steep street that led to the bridge across the Arga. There were many people walking to go and see the bulls, and carriages drove down the hill and across the bridge, the drivers, the horses, and the whips rising above the walking people in the street. Across the bridge we turned up a road to the corrals. We passed a wine-shop with a sign in the window: Good Wine 30 Centimes A Liter. "That's where we'll go when funds get low," Brett said. The woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we passed. She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the window and stared. They were staring at Brett. At the gate of the corrals two men took tickets from the people that went in. We went in through the gate. There were trees inside and a low, stone house. At the far end was the stone wall of the corrals, with apertures in the stone that were like loopholes running all along the face of each corral. A ladder led up to the top of the wall, and people were climbing up the ladder and spreading down to stand on the walls that separated the two corrals. As we came up the ladder, walking across the grass under the trees, we passed the big, gray painted cages with the bulls in them. There was one bull in each travelling-box. They had come by train from a bull-breeding ranch in Castile, and had been unloaded off flat-cars at the station and brought up here to be let out of their cages into the corrals. Each cage was stencilled with the name and the brand of the bull-breeder. We climbed up and found a place on the wall looking down into the corral. The stone walls were whitewashed, and there was straw on the ground and wooden feed-boxes and water-troughs set against the wall. "Look up there," I said. Beyond the river rose the plateau of the town. All along the old walls and ramparts people were standing. The three lines of fortifications made three black lines of people. Above the walls there were heads in the windows of the houses. At the far end of the plateau boys had climbed into the trees. "They must think something is going to happen," Brett said. "They want to see the bulls." Mike and Bill were on the other wall across the pit of the corral. They waved to us. People who had come late were standing behind us, pressing against us when other people crowded them. "Why don't they start?" Robert Cohn asked. A single mule was hitched to one of the cages and dragged it up against the gate in the corral wall. The men shoved and lifted it with crowbars into position against the gate. Men were standing on the wall ready to pull up the gate of the corral and then the gate of the cage. At the other end of the corral a gate opened and two steers came in, swaying their heads and trotting, their lean flanks swinging. They stood together at the far end, their heads toward the gate where the bull would enter. "They don't look happy," Brett said. The men on top of the wall leaned back and pulled up the door of the corral. Then they pulled up the door of the cage. I leaned way over the wall and tried to see into the cage. It was dark. Some one rapped on the cage with an iron bar. Inside something seemed to explode. The bull, striking into the wood from side to side with his horns, made a great noise. Then I saw a dark muzzle and the shadow of horns, and then, with a clattering on the wood in the hollow box, the bull charged and came out into the corral, skidding with his forefeet in the straw as he stopped, his head up, the great hump of muscle on his neck swollen tight, his body muscles quivering as he looked up at the crowd on the stone walls. The two steers backed away against the wall, their heads sunken, their eyes watching the bull. The bull saw them and charged. A man shouted from behind one of the boxes and slapped his hat against the planks, and the bull, before he reached the steer, turned, gathered himself and charged where the man had been, trying to reach him behind the planks with a half-dozen quick, searching drives with the right horn. "My God, isn't he beautiful?" Brett said. We were looking right down on him. "Look how he knows how to use his horns," I said. "He's got a left and a right just like a boxer." "Not really?" "You watch." "It goes too fast." "Wait. There'll be another one in a minute." They had backed up another cage into the entrance. In the far corner a man, from behind one of the plank shelters, attracted the bull, and while the bull was facing away the gate was pulled up and a second bull came out into the corral. He charged straight for the steers and two men ran out from behind the planks and shouted, to turn him. He did not change his direction and the men shouted: "Hah! Hah! Toro!" and waved their arms; the two steers turned sideways to take the shock, and the bull drove into one of the steers. "Don't look," I said to Brett. She was watching, fascinated. "Fine," I said. "If it doesn't buck you." "I saw it," she said. "I saw him shift from his left to his right horn." "Damn good!" The steer was down now, his neck stretched out, his head twisted, he lay the way he had fallen. Suddenly the bull left off and made for the other steer which had been standing at the far end, his head swinging, watching it all. The steer ran awkwardly and the bull caught him, hooked him lightly in the flank, and then turned away and looked up at the crowd on the walls, his crest of muscle rising. The steer came up to him and made as though to nose at him and the bull hooked perfunctorily. The next time he nosed at the steer and then the two of them trotted over to the other bull. When the next bull came out, all three, the two bulls and the steer, stood together, their heads side by side, their horns against the newcomer. In a few minutes the steer picked the new bull up, quieted him down, and made him one of the herd. When the last two bulls had been unloaded the herd were all together. The steer who had been gored had gotten to his feet and stood against the stone wall. None of the bulls came near him, and he did not attempt to join the herd. We climbed down from the wall with the crowd, and had a last look at the bulls through the loopholes in the wall of the corral. They were all quiet now, their heads down. We got a carriage outside and rode up to the cafÃ©. Mike and Bill came in half an hour later. They had stopped on the way for several drinks. We were sitting in the cafÃ©. "That's an extraordinary business," Brett said. "Will those last ones fight as well as the first?" Robert Cohn asked. "They seemed to quiet down awfully fast." "They all know each other," I said. "They're only dangerous when they're alone, or only two or three of them together." "What do you mean, dangerous?" Bill said. "They all looked dangerous to me." "They only want to kill when they're alone. Of course, if you went in there you'd probably detach one of them from the herd, and he'd be dangerous." "That's too complicated," Bill said. "Don't you ever detach me from the herd, Mike." "I say," Mike said, "they were fine bulls, weren't they? Did you see their horns?" "Did I not," said Brett. "I had no idea what they were like." "Did you see the one hit that steer?" Mike asked. "That was extraordinary." "It's no life being a steer," Robert Cohn said. "Don't you think so?" Mike said. "I would have thought you'd loved being a steer, Robert." "What do you mean, Mike?" "They lead such a quiet life. They never say anything and they're always hanging about so." We were embarrassed. Bill laughed. Robert Cohn was angry. Mike went on talking. "I should think you'd love it. You'd never have to say a word. Come on, Robert. Do say something. Don't just sit there." "I said something, Mike. Don't you remember? About the steers." "Oh, say something more. Say something funny. Can't you see we're all having a good time here?" "Come off it, Michael. You're drunk," Brett said. "I'm not drunk. I'm quite serious. Is Robert Cohn going to follow Brett around like a steer all the time?" "Shut up, Michael. Try and show a little breeding." "Breeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls? Aren't the bulls lovely? Don't you like them, Bill? Why don't you say something, Robert? Don't sit there looking like a bloody funeral. What if Brett did sleep with you? She's slept with lots of better people than you." "Shut up," Cohn said. He stood up. "Shut up, Mike." "Oh, don't stand up and act as though you were going to hit me. That won't make any difference to me. Tell me, Robert. Why do you follow Brett around like a poor bloody steer? Don't you know you're not wanted? I know when I'm not wanted. Why don't you know when you're not wanted? You came down to San Sebastian where you weren't wanted, and followed Brett around like a bloody steer. Do you think that's right?" "Shut up. You're drunk." "Perhaps I am drunk. Why aren't you drunk? Why don't you ever get drunk, Robert? You know you didn't have a good time at San Sebastian because none of our friends would invite you on any of the parties. You can't blame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to. They wouldn't do it. You can't blame them, now. Can you? Now, answer me. Can you blame them?" "Go to hell, Mike." "I can't blame them. Can you blame them? Why do you follow Brett around? Haven't you any manners? How do you think it makes me feel?" "You're a splendid one to talk about manners," Brett said. "You've such lovely manners." "Come on, Robert," Bill said. "What do you follow her around for?" Bill stood up and took hold of Cohn. "Don't go," Mike said. "Robert Cohn's going to buy a drink." Bill went off with Cohn. Cohn's face was sallow. Mike went on talking. I sat and listened for a while. Brett looked disgusted. "I say, Michael, you might not be such a bloody ass," she interrupted. "I'm not saying he's not right, you know." She turned to me. The emotion left Mike's voice. We were all friends together. "I'm not so damn drunk as I sounded," he said. "I know you're not," Brett said. "We're none of us sober," I said. "I didn't say anything I didn't mean." "But you put it so badly," Brett laughed. "He was an ass, though. He came down to San Sebastian where he damn well wasn't wanted. He hung around Brett and just looked at her. It made me damned well sick." "He did behave very badly," Brett said. "Mark you. Brett's had affairs with men before. She tells me all about everything. She gave me this chap Cohn's letters to read. I wouldn't read them." "Damned noble of you." "No, listen, Jake. Brett's gone off with men. But they weren't ever Jews, and they didn't come and hang about afterward." "Damned good chaps," Brett said. "It's all rot to talk about it. Michael and I understand each other." "She gave me Robert Cohn's letters. I wouldn't read them." "You wouldn't read any letters, darling. You wouldn't read mine." "I can't read letters," Mike said. "Funny, isn't it?" "You can't read anything." "No. You're wrong there. I read quite a bit. I read when I'm at home." "You'll be writing next," Brett said. "Come on, Michael. Do buck up. You've got to go through with this thing now. He's here. Don't spoil the fiesta." "Well, let him behave, then." "He'll behave. I'll tell him." "You tell him, Jake. Tell him either he must behave or get out." "Yes," I said, "it would be nice for me to tell him." "Look, Brett. Tell Jake what Robert calls you. That is perfect, you know." "Oh, no. I can't." "Go on. We're all friends. Aren't we all friends, Jake?" "I can't tell him. It's too ridiculous." "I'll tell him." "You won't, Michael. Don't be an ass." "He calls her Circe," Mike said. "He claims she turns men into swine. Damn good. I wish I were one of these literary chaps." "He'd be good, you know," Brett said. "He writes a good letter." "I know," I said. "He wrote me from San Sebastian." "That was nothing," Brett said. "He can write a damned amusing letter." "She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill." "I damned well was, too." "Come on," I said, "we must go in and eat." "How should I meet Cohn?" Mike said. "Just act as though nothing had happened." "It's quite all right with me," Mike said. "I'm not embarrassed." "If he says anything, just say you were tight." "Quite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight." "Come on," Brett said. "Are these poisonous things paid for? I must bathe before dinner." We walked across the square. It was dark and all around the square were the lights from the cafÃ©s under the arcades. We walked across the gravel under the trees to the hotel. They went up-stairs and I stopped to speak with Montoya. "Well, how did you like the bulls?" he asked. "Good. They were nice bulls." "They're all right"--Montoya shook his head--"but they're not too good." "What didn't you like about them?" "I don't know. They just didn't give me the feeling that they were so good." "I know what you mean." "They're all right." "Yes. They're all right." "How did your friends like them?" "Fine." "Good," Montoya said. I went up-stairs. Bill was in his room standing on the balcony looking out at the square. I stood beside him. "Where's Cohn?" "Up-stairs in his room." "How does he feel?" "Like hell, naturally. Mike was awful. He's terrible when he's tight." "He wasn't so tight." "The hell he wasn't. I know what we had before we came to the cafÃ©." "He sobered up afterward." "Good. He was terrible. I don't like Cohn, God knows, and I think it was a silly trick for him to go down to San Sebastian, but nobody has any business to talk like Mike." "How'd you like the bulls?" "Grand. It's grand the way they bring them out." "To-morrow come the Miuras." "When does the fiesta start?" "Day after to-morrow." "We've got to keep Mike from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is terrible." "We'd better get cleaned up for supper." "Yes. That will be a pleasant meal." "Won't it?" As a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal. Brett wore a black, sleeveless evening dress. She looked quite beautiful. Mike acted as though nothing had happened. I had to go up and bring Robert Cohn down. He was reserved and formal, and his face was still taut and sallow, but he cheered up finally. He could not stop looking at Brett. It seemed to make him happy. It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so lovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it. They could not take that away from him. Bill was very funny. So was Michael. They were good together. It was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening. Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy. It seemed they were all such nice people. CHAPTER 14 I do not know what time I got to bed. I remember undressing, putting on a bathrobe, and standing out on the balcony. I knew I was quite drunk, and when I came in I put on the light over the head of the bed and started to read. I was reading a book by Turgenieff. Probably I read the same two pages over several times. It was one of the stories in "A Sportsman's Sketches." I had read it before, but it seemed quite new. The country became very clear and the feeling of pressure in my head seemed to loosen. I was very drunk and I did not want to shut my eyes because the room would go round and round. If I kept on reading that feeling would pass. I heard Brett and Robert Cohn come up the stairs. Cohn said good night outside the door and went on up to his room. I heard Brett go into the room next door. Mike was already in bed. He had come in with me an hour before. He woke as she came in, and they talked together. I heard them laugh. I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep. It was not necessary to read any more. I could shut my eyes without getting the wheeling sensation. But I could not sleep. There is no reason why because it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is light. The hell there isn't! I figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the electric light off. That was another bright idea. To hell with women, anyway. To hell with you, Brett Ashley. Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on. I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money's worth and knowing when you had it. You could get your money's worth. The world was a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had. Perhaps that wasn't true, though. Perhaps as you went along you did learn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what it was all about. I wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though. Mike was a bad drunk. Brett was a good drunk. Bill was a good drunk. Cohn was never drunk. Mike was unpleasant after he passed a certain point. I liked to see him hurt Cohn. I wished he would not do it, though, because afterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality. That was a large statement. What a lot of bilge I could think up at night. What rot, I could hear Brett say it. What rot! When you were with English you got into the habit of using English expressions in your thinking. The English spoken language--the upper classes, anyway--must have fewer words than the Eskimo. Of course I didn't know anything about the Eskimo. Maybe the Eskimo was a fine language. Say the Cherokee. I didn't know anything about the Cherokee, either. The English talked with inflected phrases. One phrase to mean everything. I liked them, though. I liked the way they talked. Take Harris. Still Harris was not the upper classes. I turned on the light again and read. I read the Turgenieff. I knew that now, reading it in the oversensitized state of my mind after much too much brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem as though it had really happened to me. I would always have it. That was another good thing you paid for and then had. Some time along toward daylight I went to sleep. * * * * * The next two days in Pamplona were quiet, and there were no more rows. The town was getting ready for the fiesta. Workmen put up the gate-posts that were to shut off the side streets when the bulls were released from the corrals and came running through the streets in the morning on their way to the ring. The workmen dug holes and fitted in the timbers, each timber numbered for its regular place. Out on the plateau beyond the town employees of the bull-ring exercised picador horses, galloping them stiff-legged on the hard, sun-baked fields behind the bull-ring. The big gate of the bull-ring was open, and inside the amphitheatre was being swept. The ring was rolled and sprinkled, and carpenters replaced weakened or cracked planks in the barrera. Standing at the edge of the smooth rolled sand you could look up in the empty stands and see old women sweeping out the boxes. Outside, the fence that led from the last street of the town to the entrance of the bull-ring was already in place and made a long pen; the crowd would come running down with the bulls behind them on the morning of the day of the first bull-fight. Out across the plain, where the horse and cattle fair would be, some gypsies had camped under the trees. The wine and aguardiente sellers were putting up their booths. One booth advertised ANIS DEL TORO. The cloth sign hung against the planks in the hot sun. In the big square that was the centre of the town there was no change yet. We sat in the white wicker chairs on the terrasse of the cafÃ© and watched the motor-buses come in and unload peasants from the country coming in to the market, and we watched the buses fill up and start out with peasants sitting with their saddle-bags full of the things they had bought in the town. The tall gray motor-buses were the only life of the square except for the pigeons and the man with a hose who sprinkled the gravelled square and watered the streets. In the evening was the paseo. For an hour after dinner every one, all the good-looking girls, the officers from the garrison, all the fashionable people of the town, walked in the street on one side of the square while the cafÃ© tables filled with the regular after-dinner crowd. During the morning I usually sat in the cafÃ© and read the Madrid papers and then walked in the town or out into the country. Sometimes Bill went along. Sometimes he wrote in his room. Robert Cohn spent the mornings studying Spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop. Brett and Mike never got up until noon. We all had a vermouth at the cafÃ©. It was a quiet life and no one was drunk. I went to church a couple of times, once with Brett. She said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but I told her that not only was it impossible but it was not as interesting as it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know. We met Cohn as we came out of church, and although it was obvious he had followed us, yet he was very pleasant and nice, and we all three went for a walk out to the gypsy camp, and Brett had her fortune told. It was a good morning, there were high white clouds above the mountains. It had rained a little in the night and it was fresh and cool on the plateau, and there was a wonderful view. We all felt good and we felt healthy, and I felt quite friendly to Cohn. You could not be upset about anything on a day like that. That was the last day before the fiesta. CHAPTER 15 At noon of Sunday, the 6th of July, the fiesta exploded. There is no other way to describe it. People had been coming in all day from the country, but they were assimilated in the town and you did not notice them. The square was as quiet in the hot sun as on any other day. The peasants were in the outlying wine-shops. There they were drinking, getting ready for the fiesta. They had come in so recently from the plains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting in values gradually. They could not start in paying cafÃ© prices. They got their money's worth in the wine-shops. Money still had a definite value in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought. Now on the day of the starting of the fiesta of San Fermin they had been in the wine-shops of the narrow streets of the town since early morning. Going down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the cathedral, I heard them singing through the open doors of the shops. They were warming up. There were many people at the eleven o'clock mass. San Fermin is also a religious festival. I walked down the hill from the cathedral and up the street to the cafÃ© on the square. It was a little before noon. Robert Cohn and Bill were sitting at one of the tables. The marble-topped tables and the white wicker chairs were gone. They were replaced by cast-iron tables and severe folding chairs. The cafÃ© was like a battleship stripped for action. To-day the waiters did not leave you alone all morning to read without asking if you wanted to order something. A waiter came up as soon as I sat down. "What are you drinking?" I asked Bill and Robert. "Sherry," Cohn said. "Jerez," I said to the waiter. Before the waiter brought the sherry the rocket that announced the fiesta went up in the square. It burst and there was a gray ball of smoke high up above the Theatre Gayarre, across on the other side of the plaza. The ball of smoke hung in the sky like a shrapnel burst, and as I watched, another rocket came up to it, trickling smoke in the bright sunlight. I saw the bright flash as it burst and another little cloud of smoke appeared. By the time the second rocket had burst there were so many people in the arcade, that had been empty a minute before, that the waiter, holding the bottle high up over his head, could hardly get through the crowd to our table. People were coming into the square from all sides, and down the street we heard the pipes and the fifes and the drums coming. They were playing the riau-riau music, the pipes shrill and the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing. When the fifers stopped they all crouched down in the street, and when the reed-pipes and the fifes shrilled, and the flat, dry, hollow drums tapped it out again, they all went up in the air dancing. In the crowd you saw only the heads and shoulders of the dancers going up and down. In the square a man, bent over, was playing on a reed-pipe, and a crowd of children were following him shouting, and pulling at his clothes. He came out of the square, the children following him, and piped them past the cafÃ© and down a side street. We saw his blank pockmarked face as he went by, piping, the children close behind him shouting and pulling at him. "He must be the village idiot," Bill said. "My God! look at that!" Down the street came dancers. The street was solid with dancers, all men. They were all dancing in time behind their own fifers and drummers. They were a club of some sort, and all wore workmen's blue smocks, and red handkerchiefs around their necks, and carried a great banner on two poles. The banner danced up and down with them as they came down surrounded by the crowd. "Hurray for Wine! Hurray for the Foreigners!" was painted on the banner. "Where are the foreigners?" Robert Cohn asked. "We're the foreigners," Bill said. All the time rockets were going up. The cafÃ© tables were all full now. The square was emptying of people and the crowd was filling the cafÃ©s. "Where's Brett and Mike?" Bill asked. "I'll go and get them," Cohn said. "Bring them here." The fiesta was really started. It kept up day and night for seven days. The dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on. The things that happened could only have happened during a fiesta. Everything became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have any consequences. It seemed out of place to think of consequences during the fiesta. All during the fiesta you had the feeling, even when it was quiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard. It was the same feeling about any action. It was a fiesta and it went on for seven days. That afternoon was the big religious procession. San Fermin was translated from one church to another. In the procession were all the dignitaries, civil and religious. We could not see them because the crowd was too great. Ahead of the formal procession and behind it danced the riau-riau dancers. There was one mass of yellow shirts dancing up and down in the crowd. All we could see of the procession through the closely pressed people that crowded all the side streets and curbs were the great giants, cigar-store Indians, thirty feet high, Moors, a King and Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the riau-riau. They were all standing outside the chapel where San Fermin and the dignitaries had passed in, leaving a guard of soldiers, the giants, with the men who danced in them standing beside their resting frames, and the dwarfs moving with their whacking bladders through the crowd. We started inside and there was a smell of incense and people filing back into the church, but Brett was stopped just inside the door because she had no hat, so we went out again and along the street that ran back from the chapel into town. The street was lined on both sides with people keeping their place at the curb for the return of the procession. Some dancers formed a circle around Brett and started to dance. They wore big wreaths of white garlics around their necks. They took Bill and me by the arms and put us in the circle. Bill started to dance, too. They were all chanting. Brett wanted to dance but they did not want her to. They wanted her as an image to dance around. When the song ended with the sharp riau-riau! they rushed us into a wine-shop. We stood at the counter. They had Brett seated on a wine-cask. It was dark in the wine-shop and full of men singing, hard-voiced singing. Back of the counter they drew the wine from casks. I put down money for the wine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket. "I want a leather wine-bottle," Bill said. "There's a place down the street," I said. "I'll go get a couple." The dancers did not want me to go out. Three of them were sitting on the high wine-cask beside Brett, teaching her to drink out of the wine-skins. They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck. Some one insisted on giving her a glass. Somebody was teaching Bill a song. Singing it into his ear. Beating time on Bill's back. I explained to them that I would be back. Outside in the street I went down the street looking for the shop that made leather wine-bottles. The crowd was packed on the sidewalks and many of the shops were shuttered, and I could not find it. I walked as far as the church, looking on both sides of the street. Then I asked a man and he took me by the arm and led me to it. The shutters were up but the door was open. Inside it smelled of fresh tanned leather and hot tar. A man was stencilling completed wine-skins. They hung from the roof in bunches. He took one down, blew it up, screwed the nozzle tight, and then jumped on it "See! It doesn't leak." "I want another one, too. A big one." He took down a big one that would hold a gallon or more, from the roof. He blew it up, his cheeks puffing ahead of the wine-skin, and stood on the bota holding on to a chair. "What are you going to do? Sell them in Bayonne?" "No. Drink out of them." He slapped me on the back. "Good man. Eight pesetas for the two. The lowest price." The man who was stencilling the new ones and tossing them into a pile stopped. "It's true," he said. "Eight pesetas is cheap." I paid and went out and along the street back to the wine-shop. It was darker than ever inside and very crowded. I did not see Brett and Bill, and some one said they were in the back room. At the counter the girl filled the two wine-skins for me. One held two litres. The other held five litres. Filling them both cost three pesetas sixty centimos. Some one at the counter, that I had never seen before, tried to pay for the wine, but I finally paid for it myself. The man who had wanted to pay then bought me a drink. He would not let me buy one in return, but said he would take a rinse of the mouth from the new wine-bag. He tipped the big five-litre bag up and squeezed it so the wine hissed against the back of his throat. "All right," he said, and handed back the bag. In the back room Brett and Bill were sitting on barrels surrounded by the dancers. Everybody had his arms on everybody else's shoulders, and they were all singing. Mike was sitting at a table with several men in their shirt-sleeves, eating from a bowl of tuna fish, chopped onions and vinegar. They were all drinking wine and mopping up the oil and vinegar with pieces of bread. "Hello, Jake. Hello!" Mike called. "Come here. I want you to meet my friends. We're all having an hors-d'oeuvre." I was introduced to the people at the table. They supplied their names to Mike and sent for a fork for me. "Stop eating their dinner, Michael," Brett shouted from the wine-barrels. "I don't want to eat up your meal," I said when some one handed me a fork. "Eat," he said. "What do you think it's here for?" I unscrewed the nozzle of the big wine-bottle and handed it around. Every one took a drink, tipping the wine-skin at arm's length. Outside, above the singing, we could hear the music of the procession going by. "Isn't that the procession?" Mike asked. "Nada," some one said. "It's nothing. Drink up. Lift the bottle." "Where did they find you?" I asked Mike. "Some one brought me here," Mike said. "They said you were here." "Where's Cohn?" "He's passed out," Brett called. "They've put him away somewhere." "Where is he?" "I don't know." "How should we know," Bill said. "I think he's dead." "He's not dead," Mike said. "I know he's not dead. He's just passed out on Anis del Mono." As he said Anis del Mono one of the men at the table looked up, brought out a bottle from inside his smock, and handed it to me. "No," I said. "No, thanks!" "Yes. Yes. Arriba! Up with the bottle!" I took a drink. It tasted of licorice and warmed all the way. I could feel it warming in my stomach. "Where the hell is Cohn?" "I don't know," Mike said. "I'll ask. Where is the drunken comrade?" he asked in Spanish. "You want to see him?" "Yes," I said. "Not me," said Mike. "This gent." The Anis del Mono man wiped his mouth and stood up. "Come on." In a back room Robert Cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks. It was almost too dark to see his face. They had covered him with a coat and another coat was folded under his head. Around his neck and on his chest was a big wreath of twisted garlics. "Let him sleep," the man whispered. "He's all right." Two hours later Cohn appeared. He came into the front room still with the wreath of garlics around his neck. The Spaniards shouted when he came in. Cohn wiped his eyes and grinned. "I must have been sleeping," he said. "Oh, not at all," Brett said. "You were only dead," Bill said. "Aren't we going to go and have some supper?" Cohn asked. "Do you want to eat?" "Yes. Why not? I'm hungry." "Eat those garlics, Robert," Mike said. "I say. Do eat those garlics." Cohn stood there. His sleep had made him quite all right. "Do let's go and eat," Brett said. "I must get a bath." "Come on," Bill said. "Let's translate Brett to the hotel." We said good-bye to many people and shook hands with many people and went out. Outside it was dark. "What time is it do you suppose?" Cohn asked. "It's to-morrow," Mike said. "You've been asleep two days." "No," said Cohn, "what time is it?" "It's ten o'clock." "What a lot we've drunk." "You mean what a lot we've drunk. You went to sleep." Going down the dark streets to the hotel we saw the sky-rockets going up in the square. Down the side streets that led to the square we saw the square solid with people, those in the centre all dancing. It was a big meal at the hotel. It was the first meal of the prices being doubled for the fiesta, and there were several new courses. After the dinner we were out in the town. I remember resolving that I would stay up all night to watch the bulls go through the streets at six o'clock in the morning, and being so sleepy that I went to bed around four o'clock. The others stayed up. My own room was locked and I could not find the key, so I went up-stairs and slept on one of the beds in Cohn's room. The fiesta was going on outside in the night, but I was too sleepy for it to keep me awake. When I woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the release of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town. They would race through the streets and out to the bull-ring. I had been sleeping heavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of Cohn's and went out on the balcony. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the balconies were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the street. They were all running, packed close together. They passed along and up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men running faster, and then some stragglers who were really running. Behind them was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing their heads up and down. It all went out of sight around the corner. One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the bulls went right on and did not notice him. They were all running together. After they went out of sight a great roar came from the bull-ring. It kept on. Then finally the pop of the rocket that meant the bulls had gotten through the people in the ring and into the corrals. I went back in the room and got into bed. I had been standing on the stone balcony in bare feet. I knew our crowd must have all been out at the bull-ring. Back in bed, I went to sleep. Cohn woke me when he came in. He started to undress and went over and closed the window because the people on the balcony of the house just across the street were looking in. "Did you see the show?" I asked. "Yes. We were all there." "Anybody get hurt?" "One of the bulls got into the crowd in the ring and tossed six or eight people." "How did Brett like it?" "It was all so sudden there wasn't any time for it to bother anybody." "I wish I'd been up." "We didn't know where you were. We went to your room but it was locked." "Where did you stay up?" "We danced at some club." "I got sleepy," I said. "My gosh! I'm sleepy now," Cohn said. "Doesn't this thing ever stop?" "Not for a week." Bill opened the door and put his head in. "Where were you, Jake?" "I saw them go through from the balcony. How was it?" "Grand." "Where you going?" "To sleep." No one was up before noon. We ate at tables set out under the arcade. The town was full of people. We had to wait for a table. After lunch we went over to the IruÃ±a. It had filled up, and as the time for the bull-fight came it got fuller, and the tables were crowded closer. There was a close, crowded hum that came every day before the bull-fight. The cafÃ© did not make this same noise at any other time, no matter how crowded it was. This hum went on, and we were in it and a part of it. I had taken six seats for all the fights. Three of them were barreras, the first row at the ring-side, and three were sobrepuertos, seats with wooden backs, half-way up the amphitheatre. Mike thought Brett had best sit high up for her first time, and Cohn wanted to sit with them. Bill and I were going to sit in the barreras, and I gave the extra ticket to a waiter to sell. Bill said something to Cohn about what to do and how to look so he would not mind the horses. Bill had seen one season of bull-fights. "I'm not worried about how I'll stand it. I'm only afraid I may be bored," Cohn said. "You think so?" "Don't look at the horses, after the bull hits them," I said to Brett. "Watch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, but then don't look again until the horse is dead if it's been hit." "I'm a little nervy about it," Brett said. "I'm worried whether I'll be able to go through with it all right." "You'll be all right. There's nothing but that horse part that will bother you, and they're only in for a few minutes with each bull. Just don't watch when it's bad." "She'll be all right," Mike said. "I'll look after her." "I don't think you'll be bored," Bill said. "I'm going over to the hotel to get the glasses and the wine-skin," I said. "See you back here. Don't get cock-eyed." "I'll come along," Bill said. Brett smiled at us. We walked around through the arcade to avoid the heat of the square. "That Cohn gets me," Bill said. "He's got this Jewish superiority so strong that he thinks the only emotion he'll get out of the fight will be being bored." "We'll watch him with the glasses," I said. "Oh, to hell with him!" "He spends a lot of time there." "I want him to stay there." In the hotel on the stairs we met Montoya. "Come on," said Montoya. "Do you want to meet Pedro Romero?" "Fine," said Bill. "Let's go see him." We followed Montoya up a flight and down the corridor. "He's in room number eight," Montoya explained. "He's getting dressed for the bull-fight." Montoya knocked on the door and opened it. It was a gloomy room with a little light coming in from the window on the narrow street. There were two beds separated by a monastic partition. The electric light was on. The boy stood very straight and unsmiling in his bull-fighting clothes. His jacket hung over the back of a chair. They were just finishing winding his sash. His black hair shone under the electric light. He wore a white linen shirt and the sword-handler finished his sash and stood up and stepped back. Pedro Romero nodded, seeming very far away and dignified when we shook hands. Montoya said something about what great aficionados we were, and that we wanted to wish him luck. Romero listened very seriously. Then he turned to me. He was the best-looking boy I have ever seen. "You go to the bull-fight," he said in English. "You know English," I said, feeling like an idiot. "No," he answered, and smiled. One of three men who had been sitting on the beds came up and asked us if we spoke French. "Would you like me to interpret for you? Is there anything you would like to ask Pedro Romero?" We thanked him. What was there that you would like to ask? The boy was nineteen years old, alone except for his sword-handler, and the three hangers-on, and the bull-fight was to commence in twenty minutes. We wished him "Mucha suerte," shook hands, and went out. He was standing, straight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with the hangers-on as we shut the door. "He's a fine boy, don't you think so?" Montoya asked. "He's a good-looking kid," I said. "He looks like a torero," Montoya said. "He has the type." "He's a fine boy." "We'll see how he is in the ring," Montoya said. We found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my room, took it and the field-glasses, locked the door, and went down-stairs. It was a good bull-light. Bill and I were very excited about Pedro Romero. Montoya was sitting about ten places away. After Romero had killed his first bull Montoya caught my eye and nodded his head. This was a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. Of the other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable. But there was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was much. Several times during the bull-fight I looked up at Mike and Brett and Cohn, with the glasses. They seemed to be all right. Brett did not look upset. All three were leaning forward on the concrete railing in front of them. "Let me take the glasses," Bill said. "Does Cohn look bored?" I asked. "That kike!" Outside the ring, after the bull-fight was over, you could not move in the crowd. We could not make our way through but had to be moved with the whole thing, slowly, as a glacier, back to town. We had that disturbed emotional feeling that always comes after a bull-fight, and the feeling of elation that comes after a good bull-fight. The fiesta was going on. The drums pounded and the pipe music was shrill, and everywhere the flow of the crowd was broken by patches of dancers. The dancers were in a crowd, so you did not see the intricate play of the feet. All you saw was the heads and shoulders going up and down, up and down. Finally, we got out of the crowd and made for the cafÃ©. The waiter saved chairs for the others, and we each ordered an absinthe and watched the crowd in the square and the dancers. "What do you suppose that dance is?" Bill asked. "It's a sort of jota." "They're not all the same," Bill said. "They dance differently to all the different tunes." "It's swell dancing." In front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were dancing. The steps were very intricate and their faces were intent and concentrated. They all looked down while they danced. Their rope-soled shoes tapped and spatted on the pavement. The toes touched. The heels touched. The balls of the feet touched. Then the music broke wildly and the step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street. "Here come the gentry," Bill said. They were crossing the street "Hello, men," I said. "Hello, gents!" said Brett. "You saved us seats? How nice." "I say," Mike said, "that Romero what'shisname is somebody. Am I wrong?" "Oh, isn't he lovely," Brett said. "And those green trousers." "Brett never took her eyes off them." "I say, I must borrow your glasses to-morrow." "How did it go?" "Wonderfully! Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle!" "How about the horses?" "I couldn't help looking at them." "She couldn't take her eyes off them," Mike said. "She's an extraordinary wench." "They do have some rather awful things happen to them," Brett said. "I couldn't look away, though." "Did you feel all right?" "I didn't feel badly at all." "Robert Cohn did," Mike put in. "You were quite green, Robert." "The first horse did bother me," Cohn said. "You weren't bored, were you?" asked Bill. Cohn laughed. "No. I wasn't bored. I wish you'd forgive me that." "It's all right," Bill said, "so long as you weren't bored." "He didn't look bored," Mike said. "I thought he was going to be sick." "I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute." "I thought he was going to be sick. You weren't bored, were you, Robert?" "Let up on that, Mike. I said I was sorry I said it." "He was, you know. He was positively green." "Oh, shove it along, Michael." "You mustn't ever get bored at your first bull-fight, Robert," Mike said. "It might make such a mess." "Oh, shove it along, Michael," Brett said. "He said Brett was a sadist," Mike said. "Brett's not a sadist. She's just a lovely, healthy wench." "Are you a sadist, Brett?" I asked. "Hope not." "He said Brett was a sadist just because she has a good, healthy stomach." "Won't be healthy long." Bill got Mike started on something else than Cohn. The waiter brought the absinthe glasses. "Did you really like it?" Bill asked Cohn. "No, I can't say I liked it. I think it's a wonderful show." "Gad, yes! What a spectacle!" Brett said. "I wish they didn't have the horse part," Cohn said. "They're not important," Bill said. "After a while you never notice anything disgusting." "It is a bit strong just at the start," Brett said. "There's a dreadful moment for me just when the bull starts for the horse." "The bulls were fine," Cohn said. "They were very good," Mike said. "I want to sit down below, next time." Brett drank from her glass of absinthe. "She wants to see the bull-fighters close by," Mike said. "They are something," Brett said. "That Romero lad is just a child." "He's a damned good-looking boy," I said. "When we were up in his room I never saw a better-looking kid." "How old do you suppose he is?" "Nineteen or twenty." "Just imagine it." The bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first. Brett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up above. Romero was the whole show. I do not think Brett saw any other bull-fighter. No one else did either, except the hard-shelled technicians. It was all Romero. There were two other matadors, but they did not count. I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all about. I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls charged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the point of his pic so that she saw what it was all about, so that it became more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of a spectacle with unexplained horrors. I had her watch how Romero took the bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him with the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the bull. She saw how Romero avoided every brusque movement and saved his bulls for the last when he wanted them, not winded and discomposed but smoothly worn down. She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make it look as though they were working closely. She saw why she liked Romero's cape-work and why she did not like the others. Romero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and natural in line. The others twisted themselves like corkscrews, their elbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns had passed, to give a faked look of danger. Afterward, all that was faked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling. Romero's bull-fighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time. He did not have to emphasize their closeness. Brett saw how something that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it were done a little way off. I told her how since the death of Joselito all the bull-fighters had been developing a technic that simulated this appearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while the bull-fighter was really safe. Romero had the old thing, the holding of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he prepared him for the killing. "I've never seen him do an awkward thing," Brett said. "You won't until he gets frightened," I said. "He'll never be frightened," Mike said. "He knows too damned much." "He knew everything when he started. The others can't ever learn what he was born with." "And God, what looks," Brett said. "I believe, you know, that she's falling in love with this bull-fighter chap," Mike said. "I wouldn't be surprised." "Be a good chap, Jake. Don't tell her anything more about him. Tell her how they beat their old mothers." "Tell me what drunks they are." "Oh, frightful," Mike said. "Drunk all day and spend all their time beating their poor old mothers." "He looks that way," Brett said. "Doesn't he?" I said. They had hitched the mules to the dead bull and then the whips cracked, the men ran, and the mules, straining forward, their legs pushing, broke into a gallop, and the bull, one horn up, his head on its side, swept a swath smoothly across the sand and out the red gate. "This next is the last one." "Not really," Brett said. She leaned forward on the barrera. Romero waved his picadors to their places, then stood, his cape against his chest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out. After it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd. "These bull-fights are hell on one," Brett said. "I'm limp as a rag." "Oh, you'll get a drink," Mike said. The next day Pedro Romero did not fight. It was Miura bulls, and a very bad bull-fight. The next day there was no bull-fight scheduled. But all day and all night the fiesta kept on. CHAPTER 16 In the morning it was raining. A fog had come over the mountains from the sea. You could not see the tops of the mountains. The plateau was dull and gloomy, and the shapes of the trees and the houses were changed. I walked out beyond the town to look at the weather. The bad weather was coming over the mountains from the sea. The flags in the square hung wet from the white poles and the banners were wet and hung damp against the front of the houses, and in between the steady drizzle the rain came down and drove every one under the arcades and made pools of water in the square, and the streets wet and dark and deserted; yet the fiesta kept up without any pause. It was only driven under cover. The covered seats of the bull-ring had been crowded with people sitting out of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers and singers, and afterward the Val Carlos dancers in their costumes danced down the street in the rain, the drums sounding hollow and damp, and the chiefs of the bands riding ahead on their big, heavy-footed horses, their costumes wet, the horses' coats wet in the rain. The crowd was in the cafÃ©s and the dancers came in, too, and sat, their tight-wound white legs under the tables, shaking the water from their belled caps, and spreading their red and purple jackets over the chairs to dry. It was raining hard outside. I left the crowd in the cafÃ© and went over to the hotel to get shaved for dinner. I was shaving in my room when there was a knock on the door. "Come in," I called. Montoya walked in. "How are you?" he said. "Fine," I said. "No bulls to-day." "No," I said, "nothing but rain." "Where are your friends?" "Over at the IruÃ±a." Montoya smiled his embarrassed smile. "Look," he said. "Do you know the American ambassador?" "Yes," I said. "Everybody knows the American ambassador." "He's here in town, now." "Yes," I said. "Everybody's seen them." "I've seen them, too," Montoya said. He didn't say anything. I went on shaving. "Sit down," I said. "Let me send for a drink." "No, I have to go." I finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with cold water. Montoya was standing there looking more embarrassed. "Look," he said. "I've just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel that they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee to-night after dinner." "Well," I said, "it can't hurt Marcial any." "Marcial has been in San Sebastian all day. He drove over in a car this morning with Marquez. I don't think they'll be back to-night." Montoya stood embarrassed. He wanted me to say something. "Don't give Romero the message," I said. "You think so?" "Absolutely." Montoya was very pleased. "I wanted to ask you because you were an American," he said. "That's what I'd do." "Look," said Montoya. "People take a boy like that. They don't know what he's worth. They don't know what he means. Any foreigner can flatter him. They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they're through." "Like Algabeno," I said. "Yes, like Algabeno." "They're a fine lot," I said. "There's one American woman down here now that collects bull-fighters." "I know. They only want the young ones." "Yes," I said. "The old ones get fat." "Or crazy like Gallo." "Well," I said, "it's easy. All you have to do is not give him the message." "He's such a fine boy," said Montoya. "He ought to stay with his own people. He shouldn't mix in that stuff." "Won't you have a drink?" I asked. "No," said Montoya, "I have to go." He went out. I went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the arcades around the square. It was still raining. I looked in at the IruÃ±a for the gang and they were not there, so I walked on around the square and back to the hotel. They were eating dinner in the down-stairs dining-room. They were well ahead of me and it was no use trying to catch them. Bill was buying shoe-shines for Mike. Bootblacks opened the street door and each one Bill called over and started to work on Mike. "This is the eleventh time my boots have been polished," Mike said. "I say, Bill is an ass." The bootblacks had evidently spread the report. Another came in. "Limpia botas?" he said to Bill. "No," said Bill. "For this SeÃ±or." The bootblack knelt down beside the one at work and started on Mike's free shoe that shone already in the electric light. "Bill's a yell of laughter," Mike said. I was drinking red wine, and so far behind them that I felt a little uncomfortable about all this shoe-shining. I looked around the room. At the next table was Pedro Romero. He stood up when I nodded, and asked me to come over and meet a friend. His table was beside ours, almost touching. I met the friend, a Madrid bull-fight critic, a little man with a drawn face. I told Romero how much I liked his work, and he was very pleased. We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French. I reached to our table for my wine-bottle, but the critic took my arm. Romero laughed. "Drink here," he said in English. He was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased with it, and as we went on talking he brought out words he was not sure of, and asked me about them. He was anxious to know the English for Corrida de toros, the exact translation. Bull-fight he was suspicious of. I explained that bull-fight in Spanish was the lidia of a toro. The Spanish word corrida means in English the running of bulls--the French translation is Course de taureaux. The critic put that in. There is no Spanish word for bull-fight. Pedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar. He was born in Ronda. That is not far above Gibraltar. He started bull-fighting in Malaga in the bull-fighting school there. He had only been at it three years. The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of MalagueÃ±o expressions he used. He was nineteen years old, he said. His older brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in this hotel. He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked for Romero. He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring. I told him only three. It was really only two, but I did not want to explain after I had made the mistake. "Where did you see me the other time? In Madrid?" "Yes," I lied. I had read the accounts of his two appearances in Madrid in the bull-fight papers, so I was all right. "The first or the second time?" "The first." "I was very bad," he said. "The second time I was better. You remember?" He turned to the critic. He was not at all embarrassed. He talked of his work as something altogether apart from himself. There was nothing conceited or braggartly about him. "I like it very much that you like my work," he said. "But you haven't seen it yet. To-morrow, if I get a good bull, I will try and show it to you." When he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bull-fight critic nor I would think he was boasting. "I am anxious to see it," the critic said. "I would like to be convinced." "He doesn't like my work much." Romero turned to me. He was serious. The critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had been incomplete. "Wait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out." "Have you seen the bulls for to-morrow?" the critic asked me. "Yes. I saw them unloaded." Pedro Romero leaned forward. "What did you think of them?" "Very nice," I said. "About twenty-six arrobas. Very short horns. Haven't you seen them?" "Oh, yes," said Romero. "They won't weigh twenty-six arrobas," said the critic. "No," said Romero. "They've got bananas for horns," the critic said. "You call them bananas?" asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled. "You wouldn't call them bananas?" "No," I said. "They're horns all right." "They're very short," said Pedro Romero. "Very, very short. Still, they aren't bananas." "I say, Jake," Brett called from the next table, "you have deserted us." "Just temporarily," I said. "We're talking bulls." "You are superior." "Tell him that bulls have no balls," Mike shouted. He was drunk. Romero looked at me inquiringly. "Drunk," I said. "Borracho! Muy borracho!" "You might introduce your friends," Brett said. She had not stopped looking at Pedro Romero. I asked them if they would like to have coffee with us. They both stood up. Romero's face was very brown. He had very nice manners. I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was not enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to have coffee. Mike ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for everybody. There was a lot of drunken talking. "Tell him I think writing is lousy," Bill said. "Go on, tell him. Tell him I'm ashamed of being a writer." Pedro Romero was sitting beside Brett and listening to her. "Go on. Tell him!" Bill said. Romero looked up smiling. "This gentleman," I said, "is a writer." Romero was impressed. "This other one, too," I said, pointing at Cohn. "He looks like Villalta," Romero said, looking at Bill. "Rafael, doesn't he look like Villalta?" "I can't see it," the critic said. "Really," Romero said in Spanish. "He looks a lot like Villalta. What does the drunken one do?" "Nothing." "Is that why he drinks?" "No. He's waiting to marry this lady." "Tell him bulls have no balls!" Mike shouted, very drunk, from the other end of the table. "What does he say?" "He's drunk." "Jake," Mike called. "Tell him bulls have no balls!" "You understand?" I said. "Yes." I was sure he didn't, so it was all right. "Tell him Brett wants to see him put on those green pants." "Pipe down, Mike." "Tell him Brett is dying to know how he can get into those pants." "Pipe down." During this Romero was fingering his glass and talking with Brett. Brett was talking French and he was talking Spanish and a little English, and laughing. Bill was filling the glasses. "Tell him Brett wants to come into----" "Oh, pipe down, Mike, for Christ's sake!" Romero looked up smiling. "Pipe down! I know that," he said. Just then Montoya came into the room. He started to smile at me, then he saw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks. He did not even nod. Montoya went out of the room. Mike was on his feet proposing a toast. "Let's all drink to--" he began. "Pedro Romero," I said. Everybody stood up. Romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it down, I rushing it a little because Mike was trying to make it clear that that was not at all what he was going to drink to. But it went off all right, and Pedro Romero shook hands with every one and he and the critic went out together. "My God! he's a lovely boy," Brett said. "And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn." "I started to tell him," Mike began. "And Jake kept interrupting me. Why do you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?" "Oh, shut up, Mike! Nobody interrupted you." "No, I'd like to get this settled." He turned away from me. "Do you think you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among us? People who are out to have a good time? For God's sake don't be so noisy, Cohn!" "Oh, cut it out, Mike," Cohn said. "Do you think Brett wants you here? Do you think you add to the party? Why don't you say something?" "I said all I had to say the other night, Mike." "I'm not one of you literary chaps." Mike stood shakily and leaned against the table. "I'm not clever. But I do know when I'm not wanted. Why don't you see when you're not wanted, Cohn? Go away. Go away, for God's sake. Take that sad Jewish face away. Don't you think I'm right?" He looked at us. "Sure," I said. "Let's all go over to the IruÃ±a." "No. Don't you think I'm right? I love that woman." "Oh, don't start that again. Do shove it along, Michael," Brett said. "Don't you think I'm right, Jake?" Cohn still sat at the table. His face had the sallow, yellow look it got when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it. The childish, drunken heroics of it. It was his affair with a lady of title. "Jake," Mike said. He was almost crying. "You know I'm right. Listen, you!" He turned to Cohn: "Go away! Go away now!" "But I won't go, Mike," said Cohn. "Then I'll make you!" Mike started toward him around the table. Cohn stood up and took off his glasses. He stood waiting, his face sallow, his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready to do battle for his lady love. I grabbed Mike. "Come on to the cafÃ©," I said. "You can't hit him here in the hotel." "Good!" said Mike. "Good idea!" We started off. I looked back as Mike stumbled up the stairs and saw Cohn putting his glasses on again. Bill was sitting at the table pouring another glass of Fundador. Brett was sitting looking straight ahead at nothing. Outside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to get through the clouds. There was a wind blowing. The military band was playing and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the fireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons. A balloon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind or blown against the houses of the square. Some fell into the crowd. The magnesium flared and the fireworks exploded and chased about in the crowd. There was no one dancing in the square. The gravel was too wet. Brett came out with Bill and joined us. We stood in the crowd and watched Don Manuel Orquito, the fireworks king, standing on a little platform, carefully starting the balloons with sticks, standing above the heads of the crowd to launch the balloons off into the wind. The wind brought them all down, and Don Manuel Orquito's face was sweaty in the light of his complicated fireworks that fell into the crowd and charged and chased, sputtering and cracking, between the legs of the people. The people shouted as each new luminous paper bubble careened, caught fire, and fell. "They're razzing Don Manuel," Bill said. "How do you know he's Don Manuel?" Brett said. "His name's on the programme. Don Manuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of esta ciudad." "Globos illuminados," Mike said. "A collection of globos illuminados. That's what the paper said." The wind blew the band music away. "I say, I wish one would go up," Brett said. "That Don Manuel chap is furious." "He's probably worked for weeks fixing them to go off, spelling out 'Hail to San Fermin,'" Bill said. "Globos illuminados," Mike said. "A bunch of bloody globos illuminados." "Come on," said Brett. "We can't stand here." "Her ladyship wants a drink," Mike said. "How you know things," Brett said. Inside, the cafÃ© was crowded and very noisy. No one noticed us come in. We could not find a table. There was a great noise going on. "Come on, let's get out of here," Bill said. Outside the paseo was going in under the arcade. There were some English and Americans from Biarritz in sport clothes scattered at the tables. Some of the women stared at the people going by with lorgnons. We had acquired, at some time, a friend of Bill's from Biarritz. She was staying with another girl at the Grand Hotel. The other girl had a headache and had gone to bed. "Here's the pub," Mike said. It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar where you could get food and where they danced in the back room. We all sat down at a table and ordered a bottle of Fundador. The bar was not full. There was nothing going on. "This is a hell of a place," Bill said. "It's too early." "Let's take the bottle and come back later," Bill said. "I don't want to sit here on a night like this." "Let's go and look at the English," Mike said. "I love to look at the English." "They're awful," Bill said. "Where did they all come from?" "They come from Biarritz," Mike said, "They come to see the last day of the quaint little Spanish fiesta." "I'll festa them," Bill said. "You're an extraordinarily beautiful girl." Mike turned to Bill's friend. "When did you come here?" "Come off it, Michael." "I say, she is a lovely girl. Where have I been? Where have I been looking all this while? You're a lovely thing. Have we met? Come along with me and Bill. We're going to festa the English." "I'll festa them," Bill said, "What the hell are they doing at this fiesta?" "Come on," Mike said. "Just us three. We're going to festa the bloody English. I hope you're not English? I'm Scotch. I hate the English. I'm going to festa them. Come on, Bill." Through the window we saw them, all three arm in arm, going toward the cafÃ©. Rockets were going up in the square. "I'm going to sit here," Brett said. "I'll stay with you," Cohn said. "Oh, don't!" Brett said. "For God's sake, go off somewhere. Can't you see Jake and I want to talk?" "I didn't," Cohn said. "I thought I'd sit here because I felt a little tight." "What a hell of a reason for sitting with any one. If you're tight, go to bed. Go on to bed." "Was I rude enough to him?" Brett asked. Cohn was gone. "My God! I'm so sick of him!" "He doesn't add much to the gayety." "He depresses me so." "He's behaved very badly." "Damned badly. He had a chance to behave so well." "He's probably waiting just outside the door now." "Yes. He would. You know I do know how he feels. He can't believe it didn't mean anything." "I know." "Nobody else would behave as badly. Oh, I'm so sick of the whole thing. And Michael. Michael's been lovely, too." "It's been damned hard on Mike." "Yes. But he didn't need to be a swine." "Everybody behaves badly," I said. "Give them the proper chance." "You wouldn't behave badly." Brett looked at me. "I'd be as big an ass as Cohn," I said. "Darling, don't let's talk a lot of rot." "All right. Talk about anything you like." "Don't be difficult. You're the only person I've got, and I feel rather awful to-night." "You've got Mike." "Yes, Mike. Hasn't he been pretty?" "Well," I said, "it's been damned hard on Mike, having Cohn around and seeing him with you." "Don't I know it, darling? Please don't make me feel any worse than I do." Brett was nervous as I had never seen her before. She kept looking away from me and looking ahead at the wall. "Want to go for a walk?" "Yes. Come on." I corked up the Fundador bottle and gave it to the bartender. "Let's have one more drink of that," Brett said. "My nerves are rotten." We each drank a glass of the smooth amontillado brandy. "Come on," said Brett. As we came out the door I saw Cohn walk out from under the arcade. "He was there," Brett said. "He can't be away from you." "Poor devil!" "I'm not sorry for him. I hate him, myself." "I hate him, too," she shivered. "I hate his damned suffering." We walked arm in arm down the side street away from the crowd and the lights of the square. The street was dark and wet, and we walked along it to the fortifications at the edge of town. We passed wine-shops with light coming out from their doors onto the black, wet street, and sudden bursts of music. "Want to go in?" "No." We walked out across the wet grass and onto the stone wall of the fortifications. I spread a newspaper on the stone and Brett sat down. Across the plain it was dark, and we could see the mountains. The wind was high up and took the clouds across the moon. Below us were the dark pits of the fortifications. Behind were the trees and the shadow of the cathedral, and the town silhouetted against the moon. "Don't feel bad," I said. "I feel like hell," Brett said. "Don't let's talk." We looked out at the plain. The long lines of trees were dark in the moonlight. There were the lights of a car on the road climbing the mountain. Up on the top of the mountain we saw the lights of the fort. Below to the left was the river. It was high from the rain, and black and smooth. Trees were dark along the banks. We sat and looked out. Brett stared straight ahead. Suddenly she shivered. "It's cold." "Want to walk back?" "Through the park." We climbed down. It was clouding over again. In the park it was dark under the trees. "Do you still love me, Jake?" "Yes," I said. "Because I'm a goner," Brett said. "How?" "I'm a goner. I'm mad about the Romero boy. I'm in love with him, I think." "I wouldn't be if I were you." "I can't help it. I'm a goner. It's tearing me all up inside." "Don't do it." "I can't help it. I've never been able to help anything." "You ought to stop it." "How can I stop it? I can't stop things. Feel that?" Her hand was trembling. "I'm like that all through." "You oughtn't to do it." "I can't help it. I'm a goner now, anyway. Don't you see the difference?" "No." "I've got to do something. I've got to do something I really want to do. I've lost my self-respect." "You don't have to do that." "Oh, darling, don't be difficult. What do you think it's meant to have that damned Jew about, and Mike the way he's acted?" "Sure." "I can't just stay tight all the time." "No." "Oh, darling, please stay by me. Please stay by me and see me through this." "Sure." "I don't say it's right. It is right though for me. God knows, I've never felt such a bitch." "What do you want me to do?" "Come on," Brett said. "Let's go and find him." Together we walked down the gravel path in the park in the dark, under the trees and then out from under the trees and past the gate into the street that led into town. Pedro Romero was in the cafÃ©. He was at a table with other bull-fighters and bull-fight critics. They were smoking cigars. When we came in they looked up. Romero smiled and bowed. We sat down at a table half-way down the room. "Ask him to come over and have a drink." "Not yet. He'll come over." "I can't look at him." "He's nice to look at," I said. "I've always done just what I wanted." "I know." "I do feel such a bitch." "Well," I said. "My God!" said Brett, "the things a woman goes through." "Yes?" "Oh, I do feel such a bitch." I looked across at the table. Pedro Romero smiled. He said something to the other people at his table, and stood up. He came over to our table. I stood up and we shook hands. "Won't you have a drink?" "You must have a drink with me," he said. He seated himself, asking Brett's permission without saying anything. He had very nice manners. But he kept on smoking his cigar. It went well with his face. "You like cigars?" I asked. "Oh, yes. I always smoke cigars." It was part of his system of authority. It made him seem older. I noticed his skin. It was clear and smooth and very brown. There was a triangular scar on his cheek-bone. I saw he was watching Brett. He felt there was something between them. He must have felt it when Brett gave him her hand. He was being very careful. I think he was sure, but he did not want to make any mistake. "You fight to-morrow?" I said. "Yes," he said. "Algabeno was hurt to-day in Madrid. Did you hear?" "No," I said. "Badly?" He shook his head. "Nothing. Here," he showed his hand. Brett reached out and spread the fingers apart. "Oh!" he said in English, "you tell fortunes?" "Sometimes. Do you mind?" "No. I like it." He spread his hand flat on the table. "Tell me I live for always, and be a millionaire." He was still very polite, but he was surer of himself. "Look," he said, "do you see any bulls in my hand?" He laughed. His hand was very fine and the wrist was small. "There are thousands of bulls," Brett said. She was not at all nervous now. She looked lovely. "Good," Romero laughed. "At a thousand duros apiece," he said to me in Spanish. "Tell me some more." "It's a good hand," Brett said. "I think he'll live a long time." "Say it to me. Not to your friend." "I said you'd live a long time." "I know it," Romero said. "I'm never going to die." I tapped with my finger-tips on the table. Romero saw it. He shook his head. "No. Don't do that. The bulls are my best friends." I translated to Brett. "You kill your friends?" she asked. "Always," he said in English, and laughed. "So they don't kill me." He looked at her across the table. "You know English well." "Yes," he said. "Pretty well, sometimes. But I must not let anybody know. It would be very bad, a torero who speaks English." "Why?" asked Brett. "It would be bad. The people would not like it. Not yet." "Why not?" "They would not like it. Bull-fighters are not like that." "What are bull-fighters like?" He laughed and tipped his hat down over his eyes and changed the angle of his cigar and the expression of his face. "Like at the table," he said. I glanced over. He had mimicked exactly the expression of Nacional. He smiled, his face natural again. "No. I must forget English." "Don't forget it, yet," Brett said. "No?" "No." "All right." He laughed again. "I would like a hat like that," Brett said. "Good. I'll get you one." "Right. See that you do." "I will. I'll get you one to-night." I stood up. Romero rose, too. "Sit down," I said. "I must go and find our friends and bring them here." He looked at me. It was a final look to ask if it were understood. It was understood all right. "Sit down," Brett said to him. "You must teach me Spanish." He sat down and looked at her across the table. I went out. The hard-eyed people at the bull-fighter table watched me go. It was not pleasant. When I came back and looked in the cafÃ©, twenty minutes later, Brett and Pedro Romero were gone. The coffee-glasses and our three empty cognac-glasses were on the table. A waiter came with a cloth and picked up the glasses and mopped off the table. CHAPTER 17 Outside the Bar Milano I found Bill and Mike and Edna. Edna was the girl's name. "We've been thrown out," Edna said. "By the police," said Mike. "There's some people in there that don't like me." "I've kept them out of four fights," Edna said. "You've got to help me." Bill's face was red. "Come back in, Edna," he said. "Go on in there and dance with Mike." "It's silly," Edna said. "There'll just be another row." "Damned Biarritz swine," Bill said. "Come on," Mike said. "After all, it's a pub. They can't occupy a whole pub." "Good old Mike," Bill said. "Damned English swine come here and insult Mike and try and spoil the fiesta." "They're so bloody," Mike said. "I hate the English." "They can't insult Mike," Bill said. "Mike is a swell fellow. They can't insult Mike. I won't stand it. Who cares if he is a damn bankrupt?" His voice broke. "Who cares?" Mike said. "I don't care. Jake doesn't care. Do you care?" "No," Edna said. "Are you a bankrupt?" "Of course I am. You don't care, do you, Bill?" Bill put his arm around Mike's shoulder. "I wish to hell I was a bankrupt. I'd show those bastards." "They're just English," Mike said. "It never makes any difference what the English say." "The dirty swine," Bill said. "I'm going to clean them out." "Bill," Edna looked at me. "Please don't go in again, Bill. They're so stupid." "That's it," said Mike. "They're stupid. I knew that was what it was." "They can't say things like that about Mike," Bill said. "Do you know them?" I asked Mike. "No. I never saw them. They say they know me." "I won't stand it," Bill said. "Come on. Let's go over to the Suizo," I said. "They're a bunch of Edna's friends from Biarritz," Bill said. "They're simply stupid," Edna said. "One of them's Charley Blackman, from Chicago," Bill said. "I was never in Chicago," Mike said. Edna started to laugh and could not stop. "Take me away from here," she said, "you bankrupts." "What kind of a row was it?" I asked Edna. We were walking across the square to the Suizo. Bill was gone. "I don't know what happened, but some one had the police called to keep Mike out of the back room. There were some people that had known Mike at Cannes. What's the matter with Mike?" "Probably he owes them money" I said. "That's what people usually get bitter about." In front of the ticket-booths out in the square there were two lines of people waiting. They were sitting on chairs or crouched on the ground with blankets and newspapers around them. They were waiting for the wickets to open in the morning to buy tickets for the bull-fight. The night was clearing and the moon was out. Some of the people in the line were sleeping. At the CafÃ© Suizo we had just sat down and ordered Fundador when Robert Cohn came up. "Where's Brett?" he asked. "I don't know." "She was with you." "She must have gone to bed." "She's not." "I don't know where she is." His face was sallow under the light. He was standing up. "Tell me where she is." "Sit down," I said. "I don't know where she is." "The hell you don't!" "You can shut your face." "Tell me where Brett is." "I'll not tell you a damn thing." "You know where she is." "If I did I wouldn't tell you." "Oh, go to hell, Cohn," Mike called from the table. "Brett's gone off with the bull-fighter chap. They're on their honeymoon." "You shut up." "Oh, go to hell!" Mike said languidly. "Is that where she is?" Cohn turned to me. "Go to hell!" "She was with you. Is that where she is?" "Go to hell!" "I'll make you tell me"--he stepped forward--"you damned pimp." I swung at him and he ducked. I saw his face duck sideways in the light. He hit me and I sat down on the pavement. As I started to get on my feet he hit me twice. I went down backward under a table. I tried to get up and felt I did not have any legs. I felt I must get on my feet and try and hit him. Mike helped me up. Some one poured a carafe of water on my head. Mike had an arm around me, and I found I was sitting on a chair. Mike was pulling at my ears. "I say, you were cold," Mike said. "Where the hell were you?" "Oh, I was around." "You didn't want to mix in it?" "He knocked Mike down, too," Edna said. "He didn't knock me out," Mike said. "I just lay there." "Does this happen every night at your fiestas?" Edna asked. "Wasn't that Mr. Cohn?" "I'm all right," I said. "My head's a little wobbly." There were several waiters and a crowd of people standing around. "Vaya!" said Mike. "Get away. Go on." The waiters moved the people away. "It was quite a thing to watch," Edna said. "He must be a boxer." "He is." "I wish Bill had been here," Edna said. "I'd like to have seen Bill knocked down, too. I've always wanted to see Bill knocked down. He's so big." "I was hoping he would knock down a waiter," Mike said, "and get arrested. I'd like to see Mr. Robert Cohn in jail." "No," I said. "Oh, no," said Edna. "You don't mean that." "I do, though," Mike said. "I'm not one of these chaps likes being knocked about. I never play games, even." Mike took a drink. "I never liked to hunt, you know. There was always the danger of having a horse fall on you. How do you feel, Jake?" "All right." "You're nice," Edna said to Mike. "Are you really a bankrupt?" "I'm a tremendous bankrupt," Mike said. "I owe money to everybody. Don't you owe any money?" "Tons." "I owe everybody money," Mike said. "I borrowed a hundred pesetas from Montoya to-night." "The hell you did," I said. "I'll pay it back," Mike said. "I always pay everything back." "That's why you're a bankrupt, isn't it?" Edna said. I stood up. I had heard them talking from a long way away. It all seemed like some bad play. "I'm going over to the hotel," I said. Then I heard them talking about me. "Is he all right?" Edna asked. "We'd better walk with him." "I'm all right," I said. "Don't come. I'll see you all later." I walked away from the cafÃ©. They were sitting at the table. I looked back at them and at the empty tables. There was a waiter sitting at one of the tables with his head in his hands. Walking across the square to the hotel everything looked new and changed. I had never seen the trees before. I had never seen the flagpoles before, nor the front of the theatre. It was all different. I felt as I felt once coming home from an out-of-town football game. I was carrying a suitcase with my football things in it, and I walked up the street from the station in the town I had lived in all my life and it was all new. They were raking the lawns and burning leaves in the road, and I stopped for a long time and watched. It was all strange. Then I went on, and my feet seemed to be a long way off, and everything seemed to come from a long way off, and I could hear my feet walking a great distance away. I had been kicked in the head early in the game. It was like that crossing the square. It was like that going up the stairs in the hotel. Going up the stairs took a long time, and I had the feeling that I was carrying my suitcase. There was a light in the room. Bill came out and met me in the hall. "Say," he said, "go up and see Cohn. He's been in a jam, and he's asking for you." "The hell with him." "Go on. Go on up and see him." I did not want to climb another flight of stairs. "What are you looking at me that way for?" "I'm not looking at you. Go on up and see Cohn. He's in bad shape." "You were drunk a little while ago," I said. "I'm drunk now," Bill said. "But you go up and see Cohn. He wants to see you." "All right," I said. It was just a matter of climbing more stairs. I went on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase. I walked down the hall to Cohn's room. The door was shut and I knocked. "Who is it?" "Barnes." "Come in, Jake." I opened the door and went in, and set down my suitcase. There was no light in the room. Cohn was lying, face down, on the bed in the dark. "Hello, Jake." "Don't call me Jake." I stood by the door. It was just like this that I had come home. Now it was a hot bath that I needed. A deep, hot bath, to lie back in. "Where's the bathroom?" I asked. Cohn was crying. There he was, face down on the bed, crying. He had on a white polo shirt, the kind he'd worn at Princeton. "I'm sorry, Jake. Please forgive me." "Forgive you, hell." "Please forgive me, Jake." I did not say anything. I stood there by the door. "I was crazy. You must see how it was." "Oh, that's all right." "I couldn't stand it about Brett." "You called me a pimp." I did not care. I wanted a hot bath. I wanted a hot bath in deep water. "I know. Please don't remember it. I was crazy." "That's all right." He was crying. His voice was funny. He lay there in his white shirt on the bed in the dark. His polo shirt. "I'm going away in the morning." He was crying without making any noise. "I just couldn't stand it about Brett. I've been through hell, Jake. It's been simply hell. When I met her down here Brett treated me as though I were a perfect stranger. I just couldn't stand it. We lived together at San Sebastian. I suppose you know it. I can't stand it any more." He lay there on the bed. "Well," I said, "I'm going to take a bath." "You were the only friend I had, and I loved Brett so." "Well," I said, "so long." "I guess it isn't any use," he said. "I guess it isn't any damn use." "What?" "Everything. Please say you forgive me, Jake." "Sure," I said. "It's all right." "I felt so terribly. I've been through such hell, Jake. Now everything's gone. Everything." "Well," I said, "so long. I've got to go." He rolled over, sat on the edge of the bed, and then stood up. "So long, Jake," he said. "You'll shake hands, won't you?" "Sure. Why not?" We shook hands. In the dark I could not see his face very well. "Well," I said, "see you in the morning." "I'm going away in the morning." "Oh, yes," I said. I went out. Cohn was standing in the door of the room. "Are you all right, Jake?" he asked. "Oh, yes," I said. "I'm all right." I could not find the bathroom. After a while I found it. There was a deep stone tub. I turned on the taps and the water would not run. I sat down on the edge of the bath-tub. When I got up to go I found I had taken off my shoes. I hunted for them and found them and carried them down-stairs. I found my room and went inside and undressed and got into bed. * * * * * I woke with a headache and the noise of the bands going by in the street. I remembered I had promised to take Bill's friend Edna to see the bulls go through the street and into the ring. I dressed and went down-stairs and out into the cold early morning. People were crossing the square, hurrying toward the bull-ring. Across the square were the two lines of men in front of the ticket-booths. They were still waiting for the tickets to go on sale at seven o'clock. I hurried across the street to the cafÃ©. The waiter told me that my friends had been there and gone. "How many were they?" "Two gentlemen and a lady." That was all right. Bill and Mike were with Edna. She had been afraid last night they would pass out. That was why I was to be sure to take her. I drank the coffee and hurried with the other people toward the bull-ring. I was not groggy now. There was only a bad headache. Everything looked sharp and clear, and the town smelt of the early morning. The stretch of ground from the edge of the town to the bull-ring was muddy. There was a crowd all along the fence that led to the ring, and the outside balconies and the top of the bull-ring were solid with people. I heard the rocket and I knew I could not get into the ring in time to see the bulls come in, so I shoved through the crowd to the fence. I was pushed close against the planks of the fence. Between the two fences of the runway the police were clearing the crowd along. They walked or trotted on into the bull-ring. Then people commenced to come running. A drunk slipped and fell. Two policemen grabbed him and rushed him over to the fence. The crowd were running fast now. There was a great shout from the crowd, and putting my head through between the boards I saw the bulls just coming out of the street into the long running pen. They were going fast and gaining on the crowd. Just then another drunk started out from the fence with a blouse in his hands. He wanted to do capework with the bulls. The two policemen tore out, collared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the fence and stood flattened out against the fence as the last of the crowd and the bulls went by. There were so many people running ahead of the bulls that the mass thickened and slowed up going through the gate into the ring, and as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy, muddy-sided, horns swinging, one shot ahead, caught a man in the running crowd in the back and lifted him in the air. Both the man's arms were by his sides, his head went back as the horn went in, and the bull lifted him and then dropped him. The bull picked another man running in front, but the man disappeared into the crowd, and the crowd was through the gate and into the ring with the bulls behind them. The red door of the ring went shut, the crowd on the outside balconies of the bull-ring were pressing through to the inside, there was a shout, then another shout. The man who had been gored lay face down in the trampled mud. People climbed over the fence, and I could not see the man because the crowd was so thick around him. From inside the ring came the shouts. Each shout meant a charge by some bull into the crowd. You could tell by the degree of intensity in the shout how bad a thing it was that was happening. Then the rocket went up that meant the steers had gotten the bulls out of the ring and into the corrals. I left the fence and started back toward the town. Back in the town I went to the cafÃ© to have a second coffee and some buttered toast. The waiters were sweeping out the cafÃ© and mopping off the tables. One came over and took my order. "Anything happen at the encierro?" "I didn't see it all. One man was badly cogido." "Where?" "Here." I put one hand on the small of my back and the other on my chest, where it looked as though the horn must have come through. The waiter nodded his head and swept the crumbs from the table with his cloth. "Badly cogido," he said. "All for sport. All for pleasure." He went away and came back with the long-handled coffee and milk pots. He poured the milk and coffee. It came out of the long spouts in two streams into the big cup. The waiter nodded his head. "Badly cogido through the back," he said. He put the pots down on the table and sat down in the chair at the table. "A big horn wound. All for fun. Just for fun. What do you think of that?" "I don't know." "That's it. All for fun. Fun, you understand." "You're not an aficionado?" "Me? What are bulls? Animals. Brute animals." He stood up and put his hand on the small of his back. "Right through the back. A cornada right through the back. For fun--you understand." He shook his head and walked away, carrying the coffee-pots. Two men were going by in the street. The waiter shouted to them. They were grave-looking. One shook his head. "Muerto!" he called. The waiter nodded his head. The two men went on. They were on some errand. The waiter came over to my table. "You hear? Muerto. Dead. He's dead. With a horn through him. All for morning fun. Es muy flamenco." "It's bad." "Not for me," the waiter said. "No fun in that for me." Later in the day we learned that the man who was killed was named Vicente Girones, and came from near Tafalla. The next day in the paper we read that he was twenty-eight years old, and had a farm, a wife, and two children. He had continued to come to the fiesta each year after he was married. The next day his wife came in from Tafalla to be with the body, and the day after there was a service in the chapel of San Fermin, and the coffin was carried to the railway-station by members of the dancing and drinking society of Tafalla. The drums marched ahead, and there was music on the fifes, and behind the men who carried the coffin walked the wife and two children.... Behind them marched all the members of the dancing and drinking societies of Pamplona, Estella, Tafalla, and Sanguesa who could stay over for the funeral. The coffin was loaded into the baggage-car of the train, and the widow and the two children rode, sitting, all three together, in an open third-class railway-carriage. The train started with a jerk, and then ran smoothly, going down grade around the edge of the plateau and out into the fields of grain that blew in the wind on the plain on the way to Tafalla. The bull who killed Vicente Girones was named Bocanegra, was Number 118 of the bull-breeding establishment of Sanchez Tabemo, and was killed by Pedro Romero as the third bull of that same afternoon. His ear was cut by popular acclamation and given to Pedro Romero, who, in turn, gave it to Brett, who wrapped it in a handkerchief belonging to myself, and left both ear and handkerchief, along with a number of Muratti cigarette-stubs, shoved far back in the drawer of the bed-table that stood beside her bed in the Hotel Montoya, in Pamplona. * * * * * Back in the hotel, the night watchman was sitting on a bench inside the door. He had been there all night and was very sleepy. He stood up as I came in. Three of the waitresses came in at the same time. They had been to the morning show at the bull-ring. They went up-stairs laughing. I followed them up-stairs and went into my room. I took off my shoes and lay down on the bed. The window was open onto the balcony and the sunlight was bright in the room. I did not feel sleepy. It must have been half past three o'clock when I had gone to bed and the bands had waked me at six. My jaw was sore on both sides. I felt it with my thumb and fingers. That damn Cohn. He should have hit somebody the first time he was insulted, and then gone away. He was so sure that Brett loved him. He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all. Some one knocked on the door. "Come in." It was Bill and Mike. They sat down on the bed. "Some encierro," Bill said. "Some encierro." "I say, weren't you there?" Mike asked. "Ring for some beer, Bill." "What a morning!" Bill said. He mopped off his face. "My God! what a morning! And here's old Jake. Old Jake, the human punching-bag." "What happened inside?" "Good God!" Bill said, "what happened, Mike?" "There were these bulls coming in," Mike said. "Just ahead of them was the crowd, and some chap tripped and brought the whole lot of them down." "And the bulls all came in right over them," Bill said. "I heard them yell." "That was Edna," Bill said. "Chaps kept coming out and waving their shirts." "One bull went along the barrera and hooked everybody over." "They took about twenty chaps to the infirmary," Mike said. "What a morning!" Bill said. "The damn police kept arresting chaps that wanted to go and commit suicide with the bulls." "The steers took them in, in the end," Mike said. "It took about an hour." "It was really about a quarter of an hour," Mike objected. "Oh, go to hell," Bill said. "You've been in the war. It was two hours and a half for me." "Where's that beer?" Mike asked. "What did you do with the lovely Edna?" "We took her home just now. She's gone to bed." "How did she like it?" "Fine. We told her it was just like that every morning." "She was impressed," Mike said. "She wanted us to go down in the ring, too," Bill said. "She likes action." "I said it wouldn't be fair to my creditors," Mike said. "What a morning," Bill said. "And what a night!" "How's your jaw, Jake?" Mike asked. "Sore," I said. Bill laughed. "Why didn't you hit him with a chair?" "You can talk," Mike said. "He'd have knocked you out, too. I never saw him hit me. I rather think I saw him just before, and then quite suddenly I was sitting down in the street, and Jake was lying under a table." "Where did he go afterward?" I asked. "Here she is," Mike said. "Here's the beautiful lady with the beer." The chambermaid put the tray with the beer-bottles and glasses down on the table. "Now bring up three more bottles," Mike said. "Where did Cohn go after he hit me?" I asked Bill. "Don't you know about that?" Mike was opening a beer-bottle. He poured the beer into one of the glasses, holding the glass close to the bottle. "Really?" Bill asked. "Why he went in and found Brett and the bull-fighter chap in the bull-fighter's room, and then he massacred the poor, bloody bull-fighter." "No." "Yes." "What a night!" Bill said. "He nearly killed the poor, bloody bull-fighter. Then Cohn wanted to take Brett away. Wanted to make an honest woman of her, I imagine. Damned touching scene." He took a long drink of the beer. "He is an ass." "What happened?" "Brett gave him what for. She told him off. I think she was rather good." "I'll bet she was," Bill said. "Then Cohn broke down and cried, and wanted to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. He wanted to shake hands with Brett, too." "I know. He shook hands with me." "Did he? Well, they weren't having any of it. The bull-fighter fellow was rather good. He didn't say much, but he kept getting up and getting knocked down again. Cohn couldn't knock him out. It must have been damned funny." "Where did you hear all this?" "Brett. I saw her this morning." "What happened finally?" "It seems the bull-fighter fellow was sitting on the bed. He'd been knocked down about fifteen times, and he wanted to fight some more. Brett held him and wouldn't let him get up. He was weak, but Brett couldn't hold him, and he got up. Then Cohn said he wouldn't hit him again. Said he couldn't do it. Said it would be wicked. So the bull-fighter chap sort of rather staggered over to him. Cohn went back against the wall. "'So you won't hit me?' "'No,' said Cohn. 'I'd be ashamed to.' "So the bull-fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the face, and then sat down on the floor. He couldn't get up, Brett said. Cohn wanted to pick him up and carry him to the bed. He said if Cohn helped him he'd kill him, and he'd kill him anyway this morning if Cohn wasn't out of town. Cohn was crying, and Brett had told him off, and he wanted to shake hands. I've told you that before." "Tell the rest," Bill said. "It seems the bull-fighter chap was sitting on the floor. He was waiting to get strength enough to get up and hit Cohn again. Brett wasn't having any shaking hands, and Cohn was crying and telling her how much he loved her, and she was telling him not to be a ruddy ass. Then Cohn leaned down to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. No hard feelings, you know. All for forgiveness. And the bull-fighter chap hit him in the face again." "That's quite a kid," Bill said. "He ruined Cohn," Mike said. "You know I don't think Cohn will ever want to knock people about again." "When did you see Brett?" "This morning. She came in to get some things. She's looking after this Romero lad." He poured out another bottle of beer. "Brett's rather cut up. But she loves looking after people. That's how we came to go off together. She was looking after me." "I know," I said. "I'm rather drunk," Mike said. "I think I'll stay rather drunk. This is all awfully amusing, but it's not too pleasant. It's not too pleasant for me." He drank off the beer. "I gave Brett what for, you know. I said if she would go about with Jews and bull-fighters and such people, she must expect trouble." He leaned forward. "I say, Jake, do you mind if I drink that bottle of yours? She'll bring you another one." "Please," I said. "I wasn't drinking it, anyway." Mike started to open the bottle. "Would you mind opening it?" I pressed up the wire fastener and poured it for him. "You know," Mike went on, "Brett was rather good. She's always rather good. I gave her a fearful hiding about Jews and bull-fighters, and all those sort of people, and do you know what she said: 'Yes. I've had such a hell of a happy life with the British aristocracy!'" He took a drink. "That was rather good. Ashley, chap she got the title from, was a sailor, you know. Ninth baronet. When he came home he wouldn't sleep in a bed. Always made Brett sleep on the floor. Finally, when he got really bad, he used to tell her he'd kill her. Always slept with a loaded service revolver. Brett used to take the shells out when he'd gone to sleep. She hasn't had an absolutely happy life. Brett. Damned shame, too. She enjoys things so." He stood up. His hand was shaky. "I'm going in the room. Try and get a little sleep." He smiled. "We go too long without sleep in these fiestas. I'm going to start now and get plenty of sleep. Damn bad thing not to get sleep. Makes you frightfully nervy." "We'll see you at noon at the IruÃ±a," Bill said. Mike went out the door. We heard him in the next room. He rang the bell and the chambermaid came and knocked at the door. "Bring up half a dozen bottles of beer and a bottle of Fundador," Mike told her. "Si, SeÃ±orito." "I'm going to bed," Bill said. "Poor old Mike. I had a hell of a row about him last night." "Where? At that Milano place?" "Yes. There was a fellow there that had helped pay Brett and Mike out of Cannes, once. He was damned nasty." "I know the story." "I didn't. Nobody ought to have a right to say things about Mike." "That's what makes it bad." "They oughtn't to have any right. I wish to hell they didn't have any right. I'm going to bed." "Was anybody killed in the ring?" "I don't think so. Just badly hurt." "A man was killed outside in the runway." "Was there?" said Bill. CHAPTER 18 At noon we were all at the cafÃ©. It was crowded. We were eating shrimps and drinking beer. The town was crowded. Every street was full. Big motor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking around the square. They brought people for the bull-fight. Sight-seeing cars came up, too. There was one with twenty-five Englishwomen in it. They sat in the big, white car and looked through their glasses at the fiesta. The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the fiesta. The fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars made little islands of onlookers. When the cars emptied, the onlookers were absorbed into the crowd. You did not see them again except as sport clothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in black smocks. The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you did not see them unless you passed close to a table. All the time there was music in the street. The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were going. Inside the cafÃ©s men with their hands gripping the table, or on each other's shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing. "Here comes Brett," Bill said. I looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking, her head up, as though the fiesta were being staged in her honor, and she found it pleasant and amusing. "Hello, you chaps!" she said. "I say, I have a thirst." "Get another big beer," Bill said to the waiter. "Shrimps?" "Is Cohn gone?" Brett asked. "Yes," Bill said. "He hired a car." The beer came. Brett started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook. She saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip. "Good beer." "Very good," I said. I was nervous about Mike. I did not think he had slept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be under control. "I heard Cohn had hurt you, Jake," Brett said. "No. Knocked me out. That was all." "I say, he did hurt Pedro Romero," Brett said. "He hurt him most badly." "How is he?" "He'll be all right. He won't go out of the room." "Does he look badly?" "Very. He was really hurt. I told him I wanted to pop out and see you chaps for a minute." "Is he going to fight?" "Rather. I'm going with you, if you don't mind." "How's your boy friend?" Mike asked. He had not listened to anything that Brett had said. "Brett's got a bull-fighter," he said. "She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out badly." Brett stood up. "I am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you, Michael." "How's your boy friend?" "Damned well," Brett said. "Watch him this afternoon." "Brett's got a bull-fighter," Mike said. "A beautiful, bloody bull-fighter." "Would you mind walking over with me? I want to talk to you, Jake." "Tell him all about your bull-fighter," Mike said. "Oh, to hell with your bull-fighter!" He tipped the table so that all the beers and the dish of shrimps went over in a crash. "Come on," Brett said. "Let's get out of this." In the crowd crossing the square I said: "How is it?" "I'm not going to see him after lunch until the fight. His people come in and dress him. They're very angry about me, he says." Brett was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was bright. "I feel altogether changed," Brett said. "You've no idea, Jake." "Anything you want me to do?" "No, just go to the fight with me." "We'll see you at lunch?" "No. I'm eating with him." We were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel. They were carrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade. "Want to take a turn out to the park?" Brett asked. "I don't want to go up yet. I fancy he's sleeping." We walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through the barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of booths. We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate. We could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed people. They were making the turn at the upper end of the park. "Don't let's go there," Brett said. "I don't want staring at just now." We stood in the sunlight. It was hot and good after the rain and the clouds from the sea. "I hope the wind goes down," Brett said. "It's very bad for him." "So do I." "He says the bulls are all right." "They're good." "Is that San Fermin's?" Brett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel. "Yes. Where the show started on Sunday." "Let's go in. Do you mind? I'd rather like to pray a little for him or something." We went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly. It was dark inside. Many people were praying. You saw them as your eyes adjusted themselves to the half-light. We knelt at one of the long wooden benches. After a little I felt Brett stiffen beside me, and saw she was looking straight ahead. "Come on," she whispered throatily. "Let's get out of here. Makes me damned nervous." Outside in the hot brightness of the street Brett looked up at the tree-tops in the wind. The praying had not been much of a success. "Don't know why I get so nervy in church," Brett said. "Never does me any good." We walked along. "I'm damned bad for a religious atmosphere," Brett said. "I've the wrong type of face. "You know," Brett said, "I'm not worried about him at all. I just feel happy about him." "Good." "I wish the wind would drop, though." "It's liable to go down by five o'clock." "Let's hope." "You might pray," I laughed. "Never does me any good. I've never gotten anything I prayed for. Have you?" "Oh, yes." "Oh, rot," said Brett. "Maybe it works for some people, though. You don't look very religious, Jake." "I'm pretty religious." "Oh, rot," said Brett. "Don't start proselyting to-day. To-day's going to be bad enough as it is." It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way since before she went off with Cohn. We were back again in front of the hotel. All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with people eating. "Do look after Mike," Brett said. "Don't let him get too bad." "Your frients haff gone up-stairs," the German maÃ®tre d'hÃ´tel said in English. He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him: "Thank you, so much. Have you anything else to say?" "No, ma'am." "Good," said Brett. "Save us a table for three," I said to the German. He smiled his dirty little pink-and-white smile. "Iss madam eating here?" "No," Brett said. "Den I think a tabul for two will be enuff." "Don't talk to him," Brett said. "Mike must have been in bad shape," she said on the stairs. We passed Montoya on the stairs. He bowed and did not smile. "I'll see you at the cafÃ©," Brett said. "Thank you, so much, Jake." We had stopped at the floor our rooms were on. She went straight down the hall and into Romero's room. She did not knock. She simply opened the door, went in, and closed it behind her. I stood in front of the door of Mike's room and knocked. There was no answer. I tried the knob and it opened. Inside the room was in great disorder. All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around. There were empty bottles beside the bed. Mike lay on the bed looking like a death mask of himself. He opened his eyes and looked at me. "Hello, Jake," he said very slowly. "I'm getting a lit tle sleep. I've want ed a lit tle sleep for a long time." "Let me cover you over." "No. I'm quite warm." "Don't go. I have n't got ten to sleep yet." "You'll sleep, Mike. Don't worry, boy." "Brett's got a bull-fighter," Mike said. "But her Jew has gone away." He turned his head and looked at me. "Damned good thing, what?" "Yes. Now go to sleep, Mike. You ought to get some sleep." "I'm just start ing. I'm go ing to get a lit tle sleep." He shut his eyes. I went out of the room and turned the door to quietly. Bill was in my room reading the paper. "See Mike?" "Yes." "Let's go and eat." "I won't eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. He was damned snotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs." "He was snotty to us, too." "Let's go out and eat in the town." We went down the stairs. On the stairs we passed a girl coming up with a covered tray. "There goes Brett's lunch," Bill said. "And the kid's," I said. Outside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up. His red cheeks were shiny. He was being polite. "I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen," he said. "Go sit at it," Bill said. We went on out across the street. We ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square. They were all men eating in the restaurant. It was full of smoke and drinking and singing. The food was good and so was the wine. We did not talk much. Afterward we went to the cafÃ© and watched the fiesta come to the boiling-point. Brett came over soon after lunch. She said she had looked in the room and that Mike was asleep. When the fiesta boiled over and toward the bull-ring we went with the crowd. Brett sat at the ringside between Bill and me. Directly below us was the callejon, the passageway between the stands and the red fence of the barrera. Behind us the concrete stands filled solidly. Out in front, beyond the red fence, the sand of the ring was smooth-rolled and yellow. It looked a little heavy from the rain, but it was dry in the sun and firm and smooth. The sword-handlers and bull-ring servants came down the callejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting capes and muletas. They were bloodstained and compactly folded and packed in the baskets. The sword-handlers opened the heavy leather sword-cases so the red wrapped hilts of the sheaf of swords showed as the leather case leaned against the fence. They unfolded the dark-stained red flannel of the muletas and fixed batons in them to spread the stuff and give the matador something to hold. Brett watched it all. She was absorbed in the professional details. "He's his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas," she said. "Why do they call them muletas?" "I don't know." "I wonder if they ever launder them." "I don't think so. It might spoil the color." "The blood must stiffen them," Bill said. "Funny," Brett said. "How one doesn't mind the blood." Below in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged everything. All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full. There was not an empty seat except in the President's box. When he came in the fight would start. Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in across the arena. Brett was watching them with the glasses. "Here, would you like to look?" I looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors. Romero was in the centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right. Back of them were their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway and in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors. Romero was wearing a black suit. His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes. I could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly marked. He was looking straight ahead. Marcial was smoking a cigarette guardedly, holding it in his hand. Belmonte looked ahead, his face wan and yellow, his long wolf jaw out. He was looking at nothing. Neither he nor Romero seemed to have anything in common with the others. They were all alone. The President came in; there was handclapping above us in the grand stand, and I handed the glasses to Brett. There was applause. The music started. Brett looked through the glasses. "Here, take them," she said. Through the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero. Marcial straightened up and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads back, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out. Behind them came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the capes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the picadors, their pics rising like lances. Behind all came the two trains of mules and the bull-ring servants. The matadors bowed, holding their hats on, before the President's box, and then came over to the barrera below us. Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed it over the fence to his sword-handler. He said something to the sword-handler. Close below us we saw Romero's lips were puffed, both eyes were discolored. His face was discolored and swollen. The sword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and handed up the cape. "Spread it out in front of you," I said. Brett leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold. The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something. A man beside me leaned over toward Brett. "He doesn't want you to spread it," he said. "You should fold it and keep it in your lap." Brett folded the heavy cape. Romero did not look up at us. He was speaking to Belmonte. Belmonte had sent his formal cape over to some friends. He looked across at them and smiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth. Romero leaned over the barrera and asked for the water-jug. The sword-handler brought it and Romero poured water over the percale of his fighting-cape, and then scuffed the lower folds in the sand with his slippered foot. "What's that for?" Brett asked. "To give it weight in the wind." "His face looks bad," Bill said. "He feels very badly," Brett said. "He should be in bed." The first bull was Belmonte's. Belmonte was very good. But because he got thirty thousand pesetas and people had stayed in line all night to buy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than very good. Belmonte's great attraction is working close to the bull. In bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of the bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull he is in great danger. Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy. People went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic sensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte. Fifteen years ago they said if you wanted to see Belmonte you should go quickly, while he was still alive. Since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls. When he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been, and when he came out of retirement the public were disappointed because no real man could work as close to the bulls as Belmonte was supposed to have done, not, of course, even Belmonte. Also Belmonte imposed conditions and insisted that his bulls should not be too large, nor too dangerously armed with horns, and so the element that was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there, and the public, who wanted three times as much from Belmonte, who was sick with a fistula, as Belmonte had ever been able to give, felt defrauded and cheated, and Belmonte's jaw came further out in contempt, and his face turned yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pain increased, and finally the crowd were actively against him, and he was utterly contemptuous and indifferent. He had meant to have a great afternoon, and instead it was an afternoon of sneers, shouted insults, and finally a volley of cushions and pieces of bread and vegetables, thrown down at him in the plaza where he had had his greatest triumphs. His jaw only went further out. Sometimes he turned to smile that toothed, long-jawed, lipless smile when he was called something particularly insulting, and always the pain that any movement produced grew stronger and stronger, until finally his yellow face was parchment color, and after his second bull was dead and the throwing of bread and cushions was over, after he had saluted the President with the same wolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the barrera to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into the callejon and leaned on the barrera below us, his head on his arms, not seeing, not hearing anything, only going through his pain. When he looked up, finally, he asked for a drink of water. He swallowed a little, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back into the ring. Because they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero. From the moment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him. Belmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to. He paid no attention to Marcial. Marcial was the sort of thing he knew all about. He had come out of retirement to compete with Marcial, knowing it was a competition gained in advance. He had expected to compete with Marcial and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he knew that the sincerity of his own bull-fighting would be so set off by the false Ã¦sthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he would only have to be in the ring. His return from retirement had been spoiled by Romero. Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully, what he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes. The crowd felt it, even the people from Biarritz, even the American ambassador saw it, finally. It was a competition that Belmonte would not enter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death. Belmonte was no longer well enough. He no longer had his greatest moments in the bull-ring. He was not sure that there were any great moments. Things were not the same and now life only came in flashes. He had flashes of the old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he had discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for their safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence, looking over at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder. So he had two small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the greatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was always with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did not give him a good feeling. It was the greatness, but it did not make bull-fighting wonderful to him any more. Pedro Romero had the greatness. He loved bull-fighting, and I think he loved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett. Everything of which he could control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon. Never once did he look up. He made it stronger that way, and did it for himself, too, as well as for her. Because he did not look up to ask if it pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him, and yet he did it for her, too. But he did not do it for her at any loss to himself. He gained by it all through the afternoon. His first "quite" was directly below us. The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. Belmonte was the first. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. The three of them were standing at the left of the horse. The picador, his hat down over his eyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in the spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the horse forward toward the bull. The bull was watching. Seemingly he watched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel point of the pic. Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head. He did not want to charge. Romero flicked his cape so the color caught the bull's eye. The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not the flash of color but a white horse, and a man leaned far over the horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of muscle on the bull's shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull's shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte. The bull did not insist under the iron. He did not really want to get at the horse. He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him out with his cape. He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. The bull's tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. The dampened, mud-weighted cape swung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just ahead of the bull. At the end of the pass they were facing each other again. Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero's cape filled again, this time on the other side. Each time he let the bull pass so close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass. It was all so slow and so controlled. It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep. He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand on his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going away. In his own bulls he was perfect. His first bull did not see well. After the first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the vision was impaired. He worked accordingly. It was not brilliant bull-fighting. It was only perfect bull-fighting. The crowd wanted the bull changed. They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with a bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order him replaced. "Why don't they change him?" Brett asked. "They've paid for him. They don't want to lose their money." "It's hardly fair to Romero." "Watch how he handles a bull that can't see the color." "It's the sort of thing I don't like to see." It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was doing it. With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or the scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent with his body. He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and would start for it, and then shift the bull's charge to the flannel and finish out the pass in the classic manner. The Biarritz crowd did not like it They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that little sidestep each time as he transferred the bull's charge from his own body to the flannel. They preferred Belmonte's imitation of himself or Marcial's imitation of Belmonte. There were three of them in the row behind us. "What's he afraid of the bull for? The bull's so dumb he only goes after the cloth." "He's just a young bull-fighter. He hasn't learned it yet." "But I thought he was fine with the cape before." "Probably he's nervous now." Out in the centre of the ring, all alone, Romero was going on with the same thing, getting so close that the bull could see him plainly, offering the body, offering it again a little closer, the bull watching dully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again and finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came, giving the bull the red cloth to follow with at little, almost imperceptible, jerk that so offended the critical judgment of the Biarritz bull-fight experts. "He's going to kill now," I said to Brett. "The bull's still strong. He wouldn't wear himself out." Out in the centre of the ring Romero profiled in front of the bull, drew the sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and sighted along the blade. The bull charged as Romero charged. Romero's left hand dropped the muleta over the bull's muzzle to blind him, his left shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and for just an instant he and the bull were one, Romero way out over the bull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had gone in between the bull's shoulders. Then the figure was broken. There was a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one hand up, facing the bull, his shirt ripped out from under his sleeve, the white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilt tight between his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling. "There he goes," Bill said. Romero was close enough so the bull could see him. His hand still up, he spoke to the bull. The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward and he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air. They handed the sword to Romero, and carrying it blade down, the muleta in his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President's box, bowed, straightened, and came over to the barrera and handed over the sword and muleta. "Bad one," said the sword-handler. "He made me sweat," said Romero. He wiped off his face. The sword-handler handed him the water-jug. Romero wiped his lips. It hurt him to drink out of the jug. He did not look up at us. Marcial had a big day. They were still applauding him when Romero's last bull came in. It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man in the morning running. During Romero's first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable. Everything he did showed it. All the concentration of the awkwardly delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out. The fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been smashed and his body hurt. He was wiping all that out now. Each thing that he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner. It was a good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged easily and surely. He was what Romero wanted in bulls. When he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the crowd made him go on. They did not want the bull killed yet, they did not want it to be over. Romero went on. It was like a course in bull-fighting. All the passes he linked up, all completed, all slow, templed and smooth. There were no tricks and no mystifications. There was no brusqueness. And each pass as it reached the summit gave you a sudden ache inside. The crowd did not want it ever to be finished. The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed directly below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to. He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade. The bull watched him. Romero spoke to the bull and tapped one of his feet. The bull charged and Romero waited for the charge, the muleta held low, sighting along the blade, his feet firm. Then without taking a step forward, he became one with the bull, the sword was in high between the shoulders, the bull had followed the low-swung flannel, that disappeared as Romero lurched clear to the left, and it was over. The bull tried to go forward, his legs commenced to settle, he swung from side to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees, and Romero's older brother leaned forward behind him and drove a short knife into the bull's neck at the base of the horns. The first time he missed. He drove the knife in again, and the bull went over, twitching and rigid. Romero's brother, holding the bull's horn in one hand, the knife in the other, looked up at the President's box. Handkerchiefs were waving all over the bull-ring. The President looked down from the box and waved his handkerchief. The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull and trotted over with it to Romero. The bull lay heavy and black on the sand, his tongue out. Boys were running toward him from all parts of the arena, making a little circle around him. They were starting to dance around the bull. Romero took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the President. The President bowed and Romero, running to get ahead of the crowd, came toward us. He leaned up against the barrera and gave the ear to Brett. He nodded his head and smiled. The crowd were all about him. Brett held down the cape. "You liked it?" Romero called. Brett did not say anything. They looked at each other and smiled. Brett had the ear in her hand. "Don't get bloody," Romero said, and grinned. The crowd wanted him. Several boys shouted at Brett. The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and the drunks. Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He fought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them, toward the exit. He did not want to be carried on people's shoulders. But they held him and lifted him. It was uncomfortable and his legs were spraddled and his body was very sore. They were lifting him and all running toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody's shoulder. He looked around at us apologetically. The crowd, running, went out the gate with him. We all three went back to the hotel. Brett went up-stairs. Bill and I sat in the down-stairs dining-room and ate some hard-boiled eggs and drank several bottles of beer. Belmonte came down in his street clothes with his manager and two other men. They sat at the next table and ate. Belmonte ate very little. They were leaving on the seven o'clock train for Barcelona. Belmonte wore a blue-striped shirt and a dark suit, and ate soft-boiled eggs. The others ate a big meal. Belmonte did not talk. He only answered questions. Bill was tired after the bull-fight. So was I. We both took a bull-fight very hard. We sat and ate the eggs and I watched Belmonte and the people at his table. The men with him were tough-looking and businesslike. "Come on over to the cafÃ©," Bill said. "I want an absinthe." It was the last day of the fiesta. Outside it was beginning to be cloudy again. The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were making up their set pieces for the night and covering them over with beech branches. Boys were watching. We passed stands of rockets with long bamboo stems. Outside the cafÃ© there was a great crowd. The music and the dancing were going on. The giants and the dwarfs were passing. "Where's Edna?" I asked Bill. "I don't know." We watched the beginning of the evening of the last night of the fiesta. The absinthe made everything seem better. I drank it without sugar in the dripping glass, and it was pleasantly bitter. "I feel sorry about Cohn," Bill said. "He had an awful time." "Oh, to hell with Cohn," I said. "Where do you suppose he went?" "Up to Paris." "What do you suppose he'll do?" "Oh, to hell with him." "What do you suppose he'll do?" "Pick up with his old girl, probably." "Who was his old girl?" "Somebody named Frances." We had another absinthe. "When do you go back?" I asked. "To-morrow." After a little while Bill said: "Well, it was a swell fiesta." "Yes," I said; "something doing all the time." "You wouldn't believe it. It's like a wonderful nightmare." "Sure," I said. "I'd believe anything. Including nightmares." "What's the matter? Feel low?" "Low as hell." "Have another absinthe. Here, waiter! Another absinthe for this seÃ±or." "I feel like hell," I said. "Drink that," said Bill. "Drink it slow." It was beginning to get dark. The fiesta was going on. I began to feel drunk but I did not feel any better. "How do you feel?" "I feel like hell." "Have another?" "It won't do any good." "Try it. You can't tell; maybe this is the one that gets it. Hey, waiter! Another absinthe for this seÃ±or!" I poured the water directly into it and stirred it instead of letting it drip. Bill put in a lump of ice. I stirred the ice around with a spoon in the brownish, cloudy mixture. "How is it?" "Fine." "Don't drink it fast that way. It will make you sick." I set down the glass. I had not meant to drink it fast. "I feel tight." "You ought to." "That's what you wanted, wasn't it?" "Sure. Get tight. Get over your damn depression." "Well, I'm tight. Is that what you want?" "Sit down." "I won't sit down," I said. "I'm going over to the hotel." I was very drunk. I was drunker than I ever remembered having been. At the hotel I went up-stairs. Brett's door was open. I put my head in the room. Mike was sitting on the bed. He waved a bottle. "Jake," he said. "Come in, Jake." I went in and sat down. The room was unstable unless I looked at some fixed point. "Brett, you know. She's gone off with the bull-fighter chap." "No." "Yes. She looked for you to say good-bye. They went on the seven o'clock train." "Did they?" "Bad thing to do," Mike said. "She shouldn't have done it." "No." "Have a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer." "I'm drunk," I said. "I'm going in and lie down." "Are you blind? I was blind myself." "Yes," I said, "I'm blind." "Well, bung-o," Mike said. "Get some sleep, old Jake." I went out the door and into my own room and lay on the bed. The bed went sailing off and I sat up in bed and looked at the wall to make it stop. Outside in the square the fiesta was going on. It did not mean anything. Later Bill and Mike came in to get me to go down and eat with them. I pretended to be asleep. "He's asleep. Better let him alone." "He's blind as a tick," Mike said. They went out. I got up and went to the balcony and looked out at the dancing in the square. The world was not wheeling any more. It was just very clear and bright, and inclined to blur at the edges. I washed, brushed my hair. I looked strange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the dining-room. "Here he is!" said Bill. "Good old Jake! I knew you wouldn't pass out." "Hello, you old drunk," Mike said. "I got hungry and woke up." "Eat some soup," Bill said. The three of us sat at the table, and it seemed as though about six people were missing. BOOK III CHAPTER 19 In the morning it was all over. The fiesta was finished. I woke about nine o'clock, had a bath, dressed, and went down-stairs. The square was empty and there were no people on the streets. A few children were picking up rocket-sticks in the square. The cafÃ©s were just opening and the waiters were carrying out the comfortable white wicker chairs and arranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the arcade. They were sweeping the streets and sprinkling them with a hose. I sat in one of the wicker chairs and leaned back comfortably. The waiter was in no hurry to come. The white-paper announcements of the unloading of the bulls and the big schedules of special trains were still up on the pillars of the arcade. A waiter wearing a blue apron came out with a bucket of water and a cloth, and commenced to tear down the notices, pulling the paper off in strips and washing and rubbing away the paper that stuck to the stone. The fiesta was over. I drank a coffee and after a while Bill came over. I watched him come walking across the square. He sat down at the table and ordered a coffee. "Well," he said, "it's all over." "Yes," I said. "When do you go?" "I don't know. We better get a car, I think. Aren't you going back to Paris?" "No. I can stay away another week. I think I'll go to San Sebastian." "I want to get back." "What's Mike going to do?" "He's going to Saint Jean de Luz." "Let's get a car and all go as far as Bayonne. You can get the train up from there to-night." "Good. Let's go after lunch." "All right. I'll get the car." We had lunch and paid the bill. Montoya did not come near us. One of the maids brought the bill. The car was outside. The chauffeur piled and strapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the front seat and we got in. The car went out of the square, along through the side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and away from Pamplona. It did not seem like a very long ride. Mike had a bottle of Fundador. I only took a couple of drinks. We came over the mountains and out of Spain and down the white roads and through the overfoliaged, wet, green, Basque country, and finally into Bayonne. We left Bill's baggage at the station, and he bought a ticket to Paris. His train left at seven-ten. We came out of the station. The car was standing out in front. "What shall we do about the car?" Bill asked. "Oh, bother the car," Mike said. "Let's just keep the car with us." "All right," Bill said. "Where shall we go?" "Let's go to Biarritz and have a drink." "Old Mike the spender," Bill said. We drove in to Biarritz and left the car outside a very Ritz place. We went into the bar and sat on high stools and drank a whiskey and soda. "That drink's mine," Mike said. "Let's roll for it." So we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup. Bill was out first roll. Mike lost to me and handed the bartender a hundred-franc note. The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece. We had another round and Mike lost again. Each time he gave the bartender a good tip. In a room off the bar there was a good jazz band playing. It was a pleasant bar. We had another round. I went out on the first roll with four kings. Bill and Mike rolled. Mike won the first roll with four jacks. Bill won the second. On the final roll Mike had three kings and let them stay. He handed the dice-cup to Bill. Bill rattled them and rolled, and there were three kings, an ace, and a queen. "It's yours, Mike," Bill said. "Old Mike, the gambler." "I'm so sorry," Mike said. "I can't get it." "What's the matter?" "I've no money," Mike said. "I'm stony. I've just twenty francs. Here, take twenty francs." Bill's face sort of changed. "I just had enough to pay Montoya. Damned lucky to have it, too." "I'll cash you a check," Bill said. "That's damned nice of you, but you see I can't write checks." "What are you going to do for money?" "Oh, some will come through. I've two weeks allowance should be here. I can live on tick at this pub in Saint Jean." "What do you want to do about the car?" Bill asked me. "Do you want to keep it on?" "It doesn't make any difference. Seems sort of idiotic." "Come on, let's have another drink," Mike said. "Fine. This one is on me," Bill said. "Has Brett any money?" He turned to Mike. "I shouldn't think so. She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya." "She hasn't any money with her?" I asked. "I shouldn't think so. She never has any money. She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to Jews." "I suppose they get it at the source," said Bill. "Quite. They're not really Jews. We just call them Jews. They're Scotsmen, I believe." "Hasn't she any at all with her?" I asked. "I hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left." "Well," Bill said, "we might as well have another drink." "Damned good idea," Mike said. "One never gets anywhere by discussing finances." "No," said Bill. Bill and I rolled for the next two rounds. Bill lost and paid. We went out to the car. "Anywhere you'd like to go, Mike?" Bill asked. "Let's take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let's drive about a little." "Fine. I'd like to see the coast. Let's drive down toward Hendaye." "I haven't any credit along the coast." "You can't ever tell," said Bill. We drove out along the coast road. There was the green of the headlands, the white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue with the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach. We drove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down the coast. Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the mountains we had come over from Pamplona. The road went on ahead. Bill looked at his watch. It was time for us to go back. He knocked on the glass and told the driver to turn around. The driver backed the car out into the grass to turn it. In back of us were the woods, below a stretch of meadow, then the sea. At the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the car and he got out. The chauffeur carried in his bags. Mike stood by the side of the car. "Good-bye, you chaps," Mike said. "It was a damned fine fiesta." "So long, Mike," Bill said. "I'll see you around," I said. "Don't worry about money," Mike said. "You can pay for the car, Jake, and I'll send you my share." "So long, Mike." "So long, you chaps. You've been damned nice." We all shook hands. We waved from the car to Mike. He stood in the road watching. We got to Bayonne just before the train left. A porter carried Bill's bags in from the consigne. I went as far as the inner gate to the tracks. "So long, fella," Bill said. "So long, kid!" "It was swell. I've had a swell time." "Will you be in Paris?" "No, I have to sail on the 17th. So long, fella!" "So long, old kid!" He went in through the gate to the train. The porter went ahead with the bags. I watched the train pull out. Bill was at one of the windows. The window passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty. I went outside to the car. "How much do we owe you?" I asked the driver. The price to Bayonne had been fixed at a hundred and fifty pesetas. "Two hundred pesetas." "How much more will it be if you drive me to San Sebastian on your way back?" "Fifty pesetas." "Don't kid me." "Thirty-five pesetas." "It's not worth it," I said. "Drive me to the Hotel Panier Fleuri." At the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip. The car was powdered with dust. I rubbed the rod-case through the dust. It seemed the last thing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta. The driver put the car in gear and went down the street. I watched it turn off to take the road to Spain. I went into the hotel and they gave me a room. It was the same room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne. That seemed a very long time ago. I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in the town. At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York Herald and sat in a cafÃ© to read it. It felt strange to be in France again. There was a safe, suburban feeling. I wished I had gone up to Paris with Bill, except that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing. I was through with fiestas for a while. It would be quiet in San Sebastian. The season does not open there until August. I could get a good hotel room and read and swim. There was a fine beach there. There were wonderful trees along the promenade above the beach, and there were many children sent down with their nurses before the season opened. In the evening there would be band concerts under the trees across from the CafÃ© Marinas. I could sit in the Marinas and listen. "How does one eat inside?" I asked the waiter. Inside the cafÃ© was a restaurant. "Well. Very well. One eats very well." "Good." I went in and ate dinner. It was a big meal for France but it seemed very carefully apportioned after Spain. I drank a bottle of wine for company. It was a ChÃ¢teau Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine was good company. Afterward I had coffee. The waiter recommended a Basque liqueur called Izzarra. He brought in the bottle and poured a liqueur-glass full. He said Izzarra was made of the flowers of the Pyrenees. The veritable flowers of the Pyrenees. It looked like hair-oil and smelled like Italian strega. I told him to take the flowers of the Pyrenees away and bring me a vieux marc. The marc was good. I had a second marc after the coffee. The waiter seemed a little offended about the flowers of the Pyrenees, so I overtipped him. That made him happy. It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy. You can never tell whether a Spanish waiter will thank you. Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason. If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I spent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable qualities. He would be glad to see me back. I would dine there again some time and he would be glad to see me, and would want me at his table. It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis. I was back in France. Next morning I tipped every one a little too much at the hotel to make more friends, and left on the morning train for San Sebastian. At the station I did not tip the porter more than I should because I did not think I would ever see him again. I only wanted a few good French friends in Bayonne to make me welcome in case I should come back there again. I knew that if they remembered me their friendship would be loyal. At Irun we had to change trains and show passports. I hated to leave France. Life was so simple in France. I felt I was a fool to be going back into Spain. In Spain you could not tell about anything. I felt like a fool to be going back into it, but I stood in line with my passport, opened my bags for the customs, bought a ticket, went through a gate, climbed onto the train, and after forty minutes and eight tunnels I was at San Sebastian. Even on a hot day San Sebastian has a certain early-morning quality. The trees seem as though their leaves were never quite dry. The streets feel as though they had just been sprinkled. It is always cool and shady on certain streets on the hottest day. I went to a hotel in the town where I had stopped before, and they gave me a room with a balcony that opened out above the roofs of the town. There was a green mountainside beyond the roofs. I unpacked my bags and stacked my books on the table beside the head of the bed, put out my shaving things, hung up some clothes in the big armoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry. Then I took a shower in the bathroom and went down to lunch. Spain had not changed to summer-time, so I was early. I set my watch again. I had recovered an hour by coming to San Sebastian. As I went into the dining-room the concierge brought me a police bulletin to fill out. I signed it and asked him for two telegraph forms, and wrote a message to the Hotel Montoya, telling them to forward all mail and telegrams for me to this address. I calculated how many days I would be in San Sebastian and then wrote out a wire to the office asking them to hold mail, but forward all wires for me to San Sebastian for six days. Then I went in and had lunch. After lunch I went up to my room, read a while, and went to sleep. When I woke it was half past four. I found my swimming-suit, wrapped it with a comb in a towel, and went down-stairs and walked up the street to the Concha. The tide was about half-way out. The beach was smooth and firm, and the sand yellow. I went into a bathing-cabin, undressed, put on my suit, and walked across the smooth sand to the sea. The sand was warm under bare feet. There were quite a few people in the water and on the beach. Out beyond where the headlands of the Concha almost met to form the harbor there was a white line of breakers and the open sea. Although the tide was going out, there were a few slow rollers. They came in like undulations in the water, gathered weight of water, and then broke smoothly on the warm sand. I waded out. The water was cold. As a roller came I dove, swam out under water, and came to the surface with all the chill gone. I swam out to the raft, pulled myself up, and lay on the hot planks. A boy and girl were at the other end. The girl had undone the top strap of her bathing-suit and was browning her back. The boy lay face downward on the raft and talked to her. She laughed at things he said, and turned her brown back in the sun. I lay on the raft in the sun until I was dry. Then I tried several dives. I dove deep once, swimming down to the bottom. I swam with my eyes open and it was green and dark. The raft made a dark shadow. I came out of water beside the raft, pulled up, dove once more, holding it for length, and then swam ashore. I lay on the beach until I was dry, then went into the bathing-cabin, took off my suit, sloshed myself with fresh water, and rubbed dry. I walked around the harbor under the trees to the casino, and then up one of the cool streets to the CafÃ© Marinas. There was an orchestra playing inside the cafÃ© and I sat out on the terrace and enjoyed the fresh coolness in the hot day, and had a glass of lemon-juice and shaved ice and then a long whiskey and soda. I sat in front of the Marinas for a long time and read and watched the people, and listened to the music. Later when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out along the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper. There was a bicycle-race on, the Tour du Pays Basque, and the riders were stopping that night in San Sebastian. In the dining-room, at one side, there was a long table of bicycle-riders, eating with their trainers and managers. They were all French and Belgians, and paid close attention to their meal, but they were having a good time. At the head of the table were two good-looking French girls, with much Rue du Faubourg Montmartre chic. I could not make out whom they belonged to. They all spoke in slang at the long table and there were many private jokes and some jokes at the far end that were not repeated when the girls asked to hear them. The next morning at five o'clock the race resumed with the last lap, San Sebastian-Bilbao. The bicycle-riders drank much wine, and were burned and browned by the sun. They did not take the race seriously except among themselves. They had raced among themselves so often that it did not make much difference who won. Especially in a foreign country. The money could be arranged. The man who had a matter of two minutes lead in the race had an attack of boils, which were very painful. He sat on the small of his back. His neck was very red and the blond hairs were sunburned. The other riders joked him about his boils. He tapped on the table with his fork. "Listen," he said, "to-morrow my nose is so tight on the handle-bars that the only thing touches those boils is a lovely breeze." One of the girls looked at him down the table, and he grinned and turned red. The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal. I had coffee out on the terrasse with the team manager of one of the big bicycle manufacturers. He said it had been a very pleasant race, and would have been worth watching if Bottechia had not abandoned it at Pamplona. The dust had been bad, but in Spain the roads were better than in France. Bicycle road-racing was the only sport in the world, he said. Had I ever followed the Tour de France? Only in the papers. The Tour de France was the greatest sporting event in the world. Following and organizing the road races had made him know France. Few people know France. All spring and all summer and all fall he spent on the road with bicycle road-racers. Look at the number of motor-cars now that followed the riders from town to town in a road race. It was a rich country and more sportif every year. It would be the most sportif country in the world. It was bicycle road-racing did it. That and football. He knew France. La France Sportive. He knew road-racing. We had a cognac. After all, though, it wasn't bad to get back to Paris. There is only one Paname. In all the world, that is. Paris is the town the most sportif in the world. Did I know the Chope de Negre? Did I not. I would see him there some time. I certainly would. We would drink another fine together. We certainly would. They started at six o'clock less a quarter in the morning. Would I be up for the depart? I would certainly try to. Would I like him to call me? It was very interesting. I would leave a call at the desk. He would not mind calling me. I could not let him take the trouble. I would leave a call at the desk. We said good-bye until the next morning. In the morning when I awoke the bicycle-riders and their following cars had been on the road for three hours. I had coffee and the papers in bed and then dressed and took my bathing-suit down to the beach. Everything was fresh and cool and damp in the early morning. Nurses in uniform and in peasant costume walked under the trees with children. The Spanish children were beautiful. Some bootblacks sat together under a tree talking to a soldier. The soldier had only one arm. The tide was in and there was a good breeze and a surf on the beach. I undressed in one of the bath-cabins, crossed the narrow line of beach and went into the water. I swam out, trying to swim through the rollers, but having to dive sometimes. Then in the quiet water I turned and floated. Floating I saw only the sky, and felt the drop and lift of the swells. I swam back to the surf and coasted in, face down, on a big roller, then turned and swam, trying to keep in the trough and not have a wave break over me. It made me tired, swimming in the trough, and I turned and swam out to the raft. The water was buoyant and cold. It felt as though you could never sink. I swam slowly, it seemed like a long swim with the high tide, and then pulled up on the raft and sat, dripping, on the boards that were becoming hot in the sun. I looked around at the bay, the old town, the casino, the line of trees along the promenade, and the big hotels with their white porches and gold-lettered names. Off on the right, almost closing the harbor, was a green hill with a castle. The raft rocked with the motion of the water. On the other side of the narrow gap that led into the open sea was another high headland. I thought I would like to swim across the bay but I was afraid of cramp. I sat in the sun and watched the bathers on the beach. They looked very small. After a while I stood up, gripped with my toes on the edge of the raft as it tipped with my weight, and dove cleanly and deeply, to come up through the lightening water, blew the salt water out of my head, and swam slowly and steadily in to shore. After I was dressed and had paid for the bath-cabin, I walked back to the hotel. The bicycle-racers had left several copies of L'Auto around, and I gathered them up in the reading-room and took them out and sat in an easy chair in the sun to read about and catch up on French sporting life. While I was sitting there the concierge came out with a blue envelope in his hand. "A telegram for you, sir." I poked my finger along under the fold that was fastened down, spread it open, and read it. It had been forwarded from Paris: COULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT. I tipped the concierge and read the message again. A postman was coming along the sidewalk. He turned in the hotel. He had a big moustache and looked very military. He came out of the hotel again. The concierge was just behind him. "Here's another telegram for you, sir." "Thank you," I said. I opened it. It was forwarded from Pamplona. COULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT. The concierge stood there waiting for another tip, probably. "What time is there a train for Madrid?" "It left at nine this morning. There is a slow train at eleven, and the Sud Express at ten to-night." "Get me a berth on the Sud Express. Do you want the money now?" "Just as you wish," he said. "I will have it put on the bill." "Do that." Well, that meant San Sebastian all shot to hell. I suppose, vaguely, I had expected something of the sort. I saw the concierge standing in the doorway. "Bring me a telegram form, please." He brought it and I took out my fountain-pen and printed: LADY ASHLEY HOTEL MONTANA MADRID ARRIVING SUD EXPRESS TOMORROW LOVE JAKE. That seemed to handle it. That was it. Send a girl off with one man. Introduce her to another to go off with him. Now go and bring her back. And sign the wire with love. That was it all right. I went in to lunch. I did not sleep much that night on the Sud Express. In the morning I had breakfast in the dining-car and watched the rock and pine country between Avila and Escorial. I saw the Escorial out of the window, gray and long and cold in the sun, and did not give a damn about it. I saw Madrid come up over the plain, a compact white sky-line on the top of a little cliff away off across the sun-hardened country. The Norte station in Madrid is the end of the line. All trains finish there. They don't go on anywhere. Outside were cabs and taxis and a line of hotel runners. It was like a country town. I took a taxi and we climbed up through the gardens, by the empty palace and the unfinished church on the edge of the cliff, and on up until we were in the high, hot, modern town. The taxi coasted down a smooth street to the Puerta del Sol, and then through the traffic and out into the Carrera San Jeronimo. All the shops had their awnings down against the heat. The windows on the sunny side of the street were shuttered. The taxi stopped at the curb. I saw the sign HOTEL MONTANA on the second floor. The taxi-driver carried the bags in and left them by the elevator. I could not make the elevator work, so I walked up. On the second floor up was a cut brass sign: HOTEL MONTANA. I rang and no one came to the door. I rang again and a maid with a sullen face opened the door. "Is Lady Ashley here?" I asked. She looked at me dully. "Is an Englishwoman here?" She turned and called some one inside. A very fat woman came to the door. Her hair was gray and stiffly oiled in scallops around her face. She was short and commanding. "Muy buenos," I said. "Is there an Englishwoman here? I would like to see this English lady." "Muy buenos. Yes, there is a female English. Certainly you can see her if she wishes to see you." "She wishes to see me." "The chica will ask her." "It is very hot." "It is very hot in the summer in Madrid." "And how cold in winter." "Yes, it is very cold in winter." Did I want to stay myself in person in the Hotel Montana? Of that as yet I was undecided, but it would give me pleasure if my bags were brought up from the ground floor in order that they might not be stolen. Nothing was ever stolen in the Hotel Montana. In other fondas, yes. Not here. No. The personages of this establishment were rigidly selectioned. I was happy to hear it. Nevertheless I would welcome the upbringal of my bags. The maid came in and said that the female English wanted to see the male English now, at once. "Good," I said. "You see. It is as I said." "Clearly." I followed the maid's back down a long, dark corridor. At the end she knocked on a door. "Hello," said Brett. "Is it you, Jake?" "It's me." "Come in. Come in." I opened the door. The maid closed it after me. Brett was in bed. She had just been brushing her hair and held the brush in her hand. The room was in that disorder produced only by those who have always had servants. "Darling!" Brett said. I went over to the bed and put my arms around her. She kissed me, and while she kissed me I could feel she was thinking of something else. She was trembling in my arms. She felt very small. "Darling! I've had such a hell of a time." "Tell me about it." "Nothing to tell. He only left yesterday. I made him go." "Why didn't you keep him?" "I don't know. It isn't the sort of thing one does. I don't think I hurt him any." "You were probably damn good for him." "He shouldn't be living with any one. I realized that right away." "No." "Oh, hell!" she said, "let's not talk about it. Let's never talk about it." "All right." "It was rather a knock his being ashamed of me. He was ashamed of me for a while, you know." "No." "Oh, yes. They ragged him about me at the cafÃ©, I guess. He wanted me to grow my hair out. Me, with long hair. I'd look so like hell." "It's funny." "He said it would make me more womanly. I'd look a fright." "What happened?" "Oh, he got over that. He wasn't ashamed of me long." "What was it about being in trouble?" "I didn't know whether I could make him go, and I didn't have a sou to go away and leave him. He tried to give me a lot of money, you know. I told him I had scads of it. He knew that was a lie. I couldn't take his money, you know." "No." "Oh, let's not talk about it. There were some funny things, though. Do give me a cigarette." I lit the cigarette. "He learned his English as a waiter in Gib." "Yes." "He wanted to marry me, finally." "Really?" "Of course. I can't even marry Mike." "Maybe he thought that would make him Lord Ashley." "No. It wasn't that. He really wanted to marry me. So I couldn't go away from him, he said. He wanted to make it sure I could never go away from him. After I'd gotten more womanly, of course." "You ought to feel set up." "I do. I'm all right again. He's wiped out that damned Cohn." "Good." "You know I'd have lived with him if I hadn't seen it was bad for him. We got along damned well." "Outside of your personal appearance." "Oh, he'd have gotten used to that." She put out the cigarette. "I'm thirty-four, you know. I'm not going to be one of these bitches that ruins children." "No." "I'm not going to be that way. I feel rather good, you know. I feel rather set up." "Good." She looked away. I thought she was looking for another cigarette. Then I saw she was crying. I could feel her crying. Shaking and crying. She wouldn't look up. I put my arms around her. "Don't let's ever talk about it. Please don't let's ever talk about it." "Dear Brett." "I'm going back to Mike." I could feel her crying as I held her close. "He's so damned nice and he's so awful. He's my sort of thing." She would not look up. I stroked her hair. I could feel her shaking. "I won't be one of those bitches," she said. "But, oh, Jake, please let's never talk about it." We left the Hotel Montana. The woman who ran the hotel would not let me pay the bill. The bill had been paid. "Oh, well. Let it go," Brett said. "It doesn't matter now." We rode in a taxi down to the Palace Hotel, left the bags, arranged for berths on the Sud Express for the night, and went into the bar of the hotel for a cocktail. We sat on high stools at the bar while the barman shook the Martinis in a large nickelled shaker. "It's funny what a wonderful gentility you get in the bar of a big hotel," I said. "Barmen and jockeys are the only people who are polite any more." "No matter how vulgar a hotel is, the bar is always nice." "It's odd." "Bartenders have always been fine." "You know," Brett said, "it's quite true. He is only nineteen. Isn't it amazing?" We touched the two glasses as they stood side by side on the bar. They were coldly beaded. Outside the curtained window was the summer heat of Madrid. "I like an olive in a Martini," I said to the barman. "Right you are, sir. There you are." "Thanks." "I should have asked, you know." The barman went far enough up the bar so that he would not hear our conversation. Brett had sipped from the Martini as it stood, on the wood. Then she picked it up. Her hand was steady enough to lift it after that first sip. "It's good. Isn't it a nice bar?" "They're all nice bars." "You know I didn't believe it at first. He was born in 1905. I was in school in Paris, then. Think of that." "Anything you want me to think about it?" "Don't be an ass. Would you buy a lady a drink?" "We'll have two more Martinis." "As they were before, sir?" "They were very good." Brett smiled at him. "Thank you, ma'am." "Well, bung-o," Brett said. "Bung-o!" "You know," Brett said, "he'd only been with two women before. He never cared about anything but bull-fighting." "He's got plenty of time." "I don't know. He thinks it was me. Not the show in general." "Well, it was you." "Yes. It was me." "I thought you weren't going to ever talk about it." "How can I help it?" "You'll lose it if you talk about it." "I just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, Jake." "You should." "You know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch." "Yes." "It's sort of what we have instead of God." "Some people have God," I said. "Quite a lot." "He never worked very well with me." "Should we have another Martini?" The barman shook up two more Martinis and poured them out into fresh glasses. "Where will we have lunch?" I asked Brett. The bar was cool. You could feel the heat outside through the window. "Here?" asked Brett. "It's rotten here in the hotel. Do you know a place called Botin's?" I asked the barman. "Yes, sir. Would you like to have me write out the address?" "Thank you." We lunched up-stairs at Botin's. It is one of the best restaurants in the world. We had roast young suckling pig and drank rioja alta. Brett did not eat much. She never ate much. I ate a very big meal and drank three bottles of rioja alta. "How do you feel, Jake?" Brett asked. "My God! what a meal you've eaten." "I feel fine. Do you want a dessert?" "Lord, no." Brett was smoking. "You like to eat, don't you?" she said. "Yes." I said. "I like to do a lot of things." "What do you like to do?" "Oh," I said, "I like to do a lot of things. Don't you want a dessert?" "You asked me that once," Brett said. "Yes," I said. "So I did. Let's have another bottle of rioja alta." "It's very good." "You haven't drunk much of it," I said. "I have. You haven't seen." "Let's get two bottles," I said. The bottles came. I poured a little in my glass, then a glass for Brett, then filled my glass. We touched glasses. "Bung-o!" Brett said. I drank my glass and poured out another. Brett put her hand on my arm. "Don't get drunk, Jake," she said. "You don't have to." "How do you know?" "Don't," she said. "You'll be all right." "I'm not getting drunk," I said. "I'm just drinking a little wine. I like to drink wine." "Don't get drunk," she said. "Jake, don't get drunk." "Want to go for a ride?" I said. "Want to ride through the town?" "Right," Brett said. "I haven't seen Madrid. I should see Madrid." "I'll finish this," I said. Down-stairs we came out through the first-floor dining-room to the street. A waiter went for a taxi. It was hot and bright. Up the street was a little square with trees and grass where there were taxis parked. A taxi came up the street, the waiter hanging out at the side. I tipped him and told the driver where to drive, and got in beside Brett. The driver started up the street. I settled back. Brett moved close to me. We sat close against each other. I put my arm around her and she rested against me comfortably. It was very hot and bright, and the houses looked sharply white. We turned out onto the Gran Via. "Oh, Jake," Brett said, "we could have had such a damned good time together." Ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic. He raised his baton. The car slowed suddenly pressing Brett against me. "Yes," I said. "Isn't it pretty to think so?" In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were peb- bles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops march- ing along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves. The plain was rich with crops; there were many orchards of fruit trees and beyond the plain the moun- tains were brown and bare. There was fighting in the mountains and at night we could see the flashes from the artillery. In the dark it was like summer lightning, but the nights were cool and there was not the feeling of a storm coming. Sometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching under the window and guns going past pulled by motor- tractors. There was much traffic at night and many mules on the roads with boxes of ammunition on each side of their pack-saddles and gray motor-trucks that carried men, and other trucks with loads covered with canvas that moved slower in the traffic. There were big guns too that passed in the day drawn by tractors, the long barrels of the guns covered with green branches and green leafy branches and vines laid over the trac- tors. To the north we could look across a valley and see 3 4 A FAREWELL TO ARMS a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another moun- tain on this side of the river. There was fighting for that mountain too, but it was not successful, and in the fall when the rains came the leaves all fell from the chestnut trees and the branches were bare and the trunks black with rain. The vineyards were thin and bare- branched too and all the country wet and brown and dead with the autumn. There were mists over the river and clouds on the mountain and the trucks splashed mud on the road and the troops were muddy and wet in their capes; their rifles were wet and under their capes the two leather cartridge-boxes on the front of the belts, gray leather boxes heavy with the packs of clips of thin, long 6.5 mm. cartridges, bulged forward under the capes so that the men, passing on the road, marched as though they were six months gone with child. There were small gray motor-cars that passed going very fast ; usually there was an officer on the seat with the driver and more officers in the back seat. They splashed more mud than the camions even and if one of the officers in the back was very small and sitting be- tween two generals, he himself so small that you could not see his face but only the top of his cap and his nar- row back, and if the car went especially fast it was probably the King. He lived in Udine and came out in this way nearly every day to see how things were going, and things went very badly. At the start of the winter came the permanent rain and with the rain came the cholera. But it was checked and in the end only seven thousand died of it in the army, CHAPTER II The next year there were many victories. The mountain that was beyond the valley and the hillside where the chestnut forest grew was captured and there were victories beyond the plain on the plateau to the south and we crossed the river in August and lived in a house in Gorizia that had a fountain and many thick shady trees in a walled garden and a wistaria vine purple on the side of the house. Now the fighting was in the next mountains beyond and was not a mile away. The town was very nice and our house was very fine. The river ran behind us and the town had been cap- tured very handsomely but the mountains beyond it could not be taken and I was very glad the Austrians seemed to want to come back to the town some time, if the war should end, because they did not bombard it to destroy it but only a little in a military way. People lived on in it and there were hospitals and cafes and artillery up side streets and two bawdy houses, one for troops and one for officers, and with the end of the summer, the cool nights, the fighting in the mountains beyond the town, the shell-marked iron of the railway bridge, the smashed tunnel by the river where the fight- ing had been, the trees around the square and the long avenue of trees that led to the square; these with there being girls in the town, the King passing in his motor car, sometimes now seeing his face and little long necked body and gray beard like a goat's chin tuft ; all these with the sudden interiors of houses that had lost a wall through shelling, with plaster and rubble in their gardens and sometimes in the street, and the whole thing s 6 A FAREWELL TO ARMS I i going well on the Carso made the fall very different from the last fall when we had been in the country. The war was changed too. The forest of oak trees on the mountain beyond the town was gone. The forest had been green in the summer when we had come into the town but now there were the stumps and the broken trunks and the ground torn up, and one day at the end of the fall when I was out where the oak forest had been I saw a cloud com- ing over the mountain. It came very fast and the sun went a dull yellow and then everything was gray and the sky was covered and the cloud came on down the mountain and suddenly we were in it and it was snow. The snow slanted across the wind, the bare ground was covered, the stumps of trees projected, there was snow on the guns and there were paths in the snow going back to the latrines behind trenches. Later, below in the town, I watched the snow falling, looking out of the window of the bawdy house, the house for officers, where I sat with a friend and two glasses drinking a bottle of Asti, and, looking out at the snow falling slowly and heavily, we knew it was all over for that year. Up the river the mountains had not been taken ; none of the mountains beyond the river had been taken. That was all left for next year. My friend saw the priest from our mess going by in the street, walking carefully in the slush, and pounded on the win- dow to attract his attention. The priest looked up. He saw us and smiled. My friend motioned for him to come in. The priest shook his head and went on. That night in the mess after the spaghetti course, which every one ate very quickly and seriously, lifting the spaghetti on the fork until the loose strands hung clear then lowering it into the mouth, or else using a con- A FAREWELL TO ARMS 7 tinuous lift and sucking into the mouth, helping our- selves to wine from the grass-covered gallon flask; it swung in a metal cradle and you pulled the neck of the flask down with the forefinger and the wine, c]g ar red, tannic and lovely, poured out into the glass held with the same hand; after this course, the captain com- menced picking on the priest. The priest was young and blushed easily and wore a uniform like the rest of us but with a cross in dark red velvet above the left breast pocket of his gray tunic. The captain spoke pidgin Italian for my doubt- ful benefit, in order that I might understand perfectly, that nothing should be lost. "Priest to-day with girls," the captain said looking at the priest and at me. The priest smiled and blushed and shook his head. This captain baited him often. "Not true?" asked the captain. "To-day I see priest with girls." "No," said the priest. The other officers were amused at the baiting. "Priest not with girls," went on the captain. "Priest never with girls," he explained to me. He took my glass and filled it, looking at my eyes all the time, but not losing sight of the priest. "Priest every night five against one." Every one at the table laughed. "You understand ? Priest every night five against one." He made a gesture and laughed loudly. The priest accepted it as a joke. "The Pope wants the Austrians to win the war," the major said. "He loves Franz Joseph. That's where the money comes from. I am an atheist." "Did you ever read the 'Black Pig' ?" asked the lieu- tenant. "I will get you a copy. It was that which shook my faith." 8 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "It is a filthy and vile book/' said the priest. "You do not really like it" "It is very valuable/' said the lieutenant. "It tells you about those priests. You will like it," he said to me. I smiled at the priest and he smiled back across the candle- light. "Don't you read it," he said. "I will get it for you," said the lieutenant. "All thinking men are atheists/' the major said. "I do not believe in the Free Masons however." "I believe in the Free Masons," the lieutenant said. "It is a noble organization." Some one came in and as the door opened I could see the snow falling. "There will be no more offensive now that the snow has come," I said. "Certainly not," said the major. "You should go on leave. You should go to Rome, Naples, Sicily " "He should visit Amalfi," said the lieutenant "I will write you cards to my family in Amalfi. They will love you like a son." "He should go to Palermo." "He ought to go to Capri." "I would like you to see Abruzzi and visit my family at Capracotta," said the priest. "Listen to him talk about the Abruzzi. There's more snow there than here. He doesn't want to see peasants. Let him go to centres of culture and civilization." "He should have fine girls. I will give you the ad- dresses of places in Naples. Beautiful young girls â€” ac- companied by their mothers. Ha ! Ha ! Ha !" The cap- tain spread his hand open, the thumb up and fingers outspread as when you make shadow pictures. There was a shadow from his hand on the wall He spoke again in pidgin Italian. "You go away like this," he A FAREWELL TO ARMS 9 pointed to the thumb, "and come back like this," he touched the little finger. Every one laughed. "Look," said the captain. He spread the hand again. Again the candle-light made its shadows on the wall. He started with the upright thumb and named in their order the thumb and four fingers, "soto-tenente (the thumb), tenente (first finger), capitano (next finger), maggiore (next to the little finger), and tenente-colo- nello (the little finger). You go away soto-tenente! You come back soto-colonello !" They all laughed. The captain was having a great success with finger games. He looked at the priest and shouted, "Every night priest five against one !" They all laughed again. "You must go on leave at once," the major said. "I would like to go with you and show you things," the lieutenant said. "When you come back bring a phonograph." "Bring good opera disks." "Bring Caruso." "Don't bring Caruso. He bellows." "Don't you wish you could bellow like him?" "He bellows. I say he bellows !" "I would like you to go to Abruzzi," the priest said. The others were shouting. "There is good hunting. You would like the people and though it is cold it is clear and dry. You could stay with my family. My father is a famous hunter." "Come on," said the captain. "We go whorehouse be- fore it shuts." "Good night," I said to the priest. "Good night," he said. CHAPTER III When I came back to the front we still lived in that town. There were many more guns in the country around and the spring had come. The fields were green and there were small green shoots on the vines, the trees along the road had small leaves and a breeze came from the sea. I saw the town with the hill and the old castle above it in a cup in the hills with the mountains beyond, brown mountains with a little green on their slopes. In the town there were more guns, there were some new hospitals, you met British men and sometimes women, on the street, and a few more houses had been hit by shell fire. It was warm and like the spring and I walked down the alleyway of trees, warmed from the sun on the wall, and found we still lived in the same house and that it all looked the same as when I had left it. The door was open, there was a soldier sitting on a bench outside in the sun, an ambulance was waiting by the side door and inside the door, as I went in, there was the smell of marble floors and hospital. It was all as I had left it except that now it was spring. I looked in the door of the big room and saw the major sitting at his desk, the window open and the sunlight coming into the room. He did not see me and I did not know whether to go in and report or go upstairs first and clean up. I decided to go on upstairs. The room I shared with the lieutenant Rinaldi looked out on the courtyard. The window was open, my bed was made up with blankets and my things hung on the wall, the gas mask in an oblong tin can, the steel helmet on the same peg. At the foot of the bed was my flat IO A FAREWELL TO ARMS u trunk, and my winter boots, the leather shiny with oil, were on the trunk. My Austrian sniper's rifle with its blued octagon barrel and the lovely dark walnut, cheek- fitted, schutzen stock, hung over the two beds. The telescope that fitted it was, I remembered, locked in the trunk. The lieutenant, Rinaldi, lay asleep on the other bed. He woke when he heard me in the room and sat up. "Ciaou!" he said. "What kind of time did you have?" "Magnificent." We shook hands and he put his arm around my neck and kissed me. "Oughf," I said. "You're dirty," he said. "You ought to wash. Where did you go and what did you do ? Tell me every- thing at once." "I went everywhere. Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples, Villa San Giovanni, Messina, Taormina " "You talk like a time-table. Did you have any beau- tiful adventures?" "Yes." "Where?" "Milano, Firenze, Roma, Napoli " "That's enough. Tell me really what was the best." "In Milano." "That was because it was first. Where did you meet her ? In the Cova ? Where did you go ? How did you feel? Tell me everything at once. Did you stay all night?" "Yes." "That's nothing. Here now we have beautiful girls. New girls never been to the front before." "Wonderful." 12 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "You don't believe me? We will go now this after- noon and see. And in the town we have beautiful English girls. I am now in love with Miss Barkley. I will take you to call. I will probably marry Miss Barkley." "I have to get washed and report. Doesn't anybody work now?" "Since you are gone we have nothing but frostbites, chilblains, jaundice, gonorrhea, self-inflicted wounds, pneumonia and hard and soft chancres. Every week some one gets wounded by rock fragments. There are a few real wounded. Next week the war starts again. Perhaps it starts again. They say so. Do you think I would do right to marry Miss Barkley â€” after the war of course?" "Absolutely," I said and poured the basin full of water. "To-night you will tell me everything," said Rinaldi. "Now I must go back to sleep to be fresh and beautiful for Miss Barkley." I took off my tunic and shirt and washed in the cold water in the basin. While I rubbed myself with a towel I looked around the room and out the window and at Rinaldi lying with his eyes closed on the bed. He was good-looking, was my age, and he came from Amalfi. He loved being a surgeon and we were great friends. While I was looking at him he opened his eyes. "Have you any money?" "Yes." "Loan me fifty lire." I dried my hands and took out my pocket-book from the inside of my tunic hanging on the wall. Rinaldi took the note, folded it without rising from the bed and slid it in his breeches pocket. He smiled, "I must make A FAREWELL TO ARMS 13 on Miss Barkley the impression of a man of sufficient wealth. You are my great and good friend and finan- cial protector." "Go to hell," I said. That night at the mess I sat next to the priest and he was disappointed and suddenly hurt that I had not gone to the Abruzzi. He had written to his father that I was coming and they had made preparations. I myself felt as badly as he did and could not understand why I had not gone. It was what I had wanted to do and I tried to explain how one thing had led to another and finally he saw it and understood that I had really wanted to go and it was almost all right. I had drunk much wine and afterward coffee and Strega and I explained, wine- fully, how we did not do the things we wanted to do ; we never did such things. We two were talking while the others argued. I had wanted to go to Abruzzi. I had gone to no place where the roads were frozen and hard as iron, where it was clear cold and dry and the snow was dry and powdery and hare-tracks in the snow and the peasants took off their hats and called you Lord and there was good hunt- ing. I had gone to no such place but to the smoke of cafes and nights when the room whirled and you needed to look at the wall to make it stop, nights in bed, drunk, when you knew that that was all there was, and the strange excitement of waking and not knowing who it was with you, and the world all unreal in the dark and so exciting that you must resume again unknowing and not caring in the night, sure that this was all and all and all and not caring. Suddenly to care very much and to sleep to wake with it sometimes morning and all that had been there gone and everything sharp and hard and clear and sometimes a dispute about the cost. i 4 A FAREWELL TO ARMS Sometimes still pleasant and fond and warm and break- fast and lunch. Sometimes all niceness gone and glad to get out on the street but always another day starting and then another night. I tried to tell about the night and the difference between the night and the day and how the night was better unless the day was very clean and cold and I could not tell it ; as I cannot tell it now. But if you have had it you know. He had not had it but he understood that I had really wanted to go to the Abruzzi but had not gone and we were still friends, with many tastes alike, but with the difference between us. He had always known what I did not know and what, when I learned it, I was always able to forget. But I did not know that then, although I learned it later. In the meantime we were all at the mess, the meal was finished, and the argument went on. We two stopped talking and the captain shouted, "Priest not happy. Priest not happy without girls." "I am happy," said the priest. "Priest not happy. Priest wants Austrians to win the war," the captain said. The others listened. The priest shook his head. "No," he said. "Priest wants us never to attack. Don't you want us never to attack?" "No. If there is a war I suppose we must attack." "Must attack. Shall attack !" The priest nodded. "Leave him alone," the major said. "He's all right." "He can't do anything about it anyway," the captain said. We all got up and left the table. CHAPTER IV The battery in the next garden woke me in the morning and I saw the sun coming through the window and got out of the bed. I went to the window and looked out. The gravel paths were moist and the grass was wet with dew. The battery fired twice and the air came each time like a blow and shook the window and made the front of my pajamas flap. I could not see the guns but they were evidently firing directly over us. It was a nuisance to have them there but it was a com- fort that they were no bigger. As I looked out at the garden I heard a motor truck starting on the road. I dressed, went downstairs, had some coffee in the kitchen and went out to the garage. Ten cars were lined up side by side under the long shed. They were top-heavy, blunt-nosed ambulances, painted gray and built like moving-vans. The mechan- ics were working on one out in the yard. Three others were up in the mountains at dressing-stations. "Do they ever shell that battery?" I asked one of the mechanics. "No, Signor Tenente. It is protected by the little hill." "How's everything?" "Not so bad. This machine is no good but the others march." He stopped working and smiled. "Were you on permission?" "Yes." He wiped his hands on his jumper and grinned. "You have a good time?" The others all grinned too. 15 16 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Fine/ 1 I said. "What's the matter with this ma- chine ?" "It's no good. One thing after another." "What's the matter now?" "New rings." I left them working, the car looking disgraced and empty with the engine open and parts spread on the work bench, and went in under the shed and looked at each of the cars. They were moderately clean, a few freshly washed, the others dusty. I looked at the tires carefully, looking for cuts or stone bruises. Every- thing seemed in good condition. It evidently made no difference whether I was there to look after things or not. I had imagined that the condition of the cars, whether or not things were obtainable, the smooth func- tioning of the business of removing wounded and sick from the dressing stations, hauling them back from the mountains to the clearing station and then distributing them to the hospitals named on their papers, depended to a considerable extent on myself. Evidently it did not matter whether I was there or not. "Has there been any trouble getting parts?" I asked the sergeant mechanic. "No, Signor Tenente." "Where is the gasoKne park now?" "At the same place." "Good," I said and went back to the house and drank another bowl of coffee at the mess table. The coffee was a pale gray and sweet with condensed milk. Outside the window it was a lovely spring morning. There was that beginning of a feeling of dryness in the nose that meant the day would be hot later on. That day I visited the posts in the mountains and was back in town late in the afternoon. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 17 The whole thing seemed to run better while I was away. The offensive was going to start again I heard. The division for which we worked were to attack at a place up the river and the major told me that I would see about the posts for during the attack. The attack would cross the river up above the narrow gorge and spread up the hillside. The posts for the cars would have to be as near the river as they could get and keep covered. They would, of course, be selected by the infantry but we were supposed to work it out. It was one of those things that gave you a false feeling of soldiering. I was very dusty and dirty and went up to my room to wash. Rinaldi was sitting on the bed with a copy of Hugo's English grammar. He was dressed, wore his black boots, and his hair shone. "Splendid," he said when he saw me. "You will come with me to see Miss Barkley." "No." "Yes. You will please come and make me a good im- pression on her." "All right. Wait till I get cleaned up." "Wash up and come as you are." I washed, brushed my hair and we started. "Wait a minute," Rinaldi said. "Perhaps we should have a drink." He opened his trunk and took out a bottle. "Not Strega," I said. "No. Grappa." "All right." He poured two glasses and we touched them, first fingers extended. The grappa was very strong. "Another?" "All right," I said. We drank the second grappa, Rinaldi put away the bottle and we went down the 18 A FAREWELL TO ARMS stairs. It was hot walking through the town but the sun was starting to go down and it was very pleasant. The British hospital was a big villa built by Germans before the war. Miss Barkley was in the garden. Another nurse was with her. We saw their white uniforms through the trees and walked toward them. Rinaldi saluted. I saluted too but more moderately. "How do you do?" Miss Barkley said. " You' re not an Italian, are you ?" "Oh, no." Rinaldi was talking with the other nurse. They were laughing. "What an odd thing â€” to be in the Italian army." "It's not really the army. It's only the ambulance." "It's very odd though. Why did you do it?" "I don't know," I said. "There isn't always an ex- planation for everything." "Oh, isn't there? I was brought up to think there was." "That's awfully nice." "Do we have to go on and talk this way?" "No," I said. "That's a relief. Isn't it?" "What is the stick?" I asked. Miss Barkley was quite tall. She wore what seemed to me to be a nurse's uniform, was blonde and had a tawny skin and gray eyes. I thought she was very beautiful. She was carry- ing a thin rattan stick like a toy riding-crop, bound in leather. "It belonged to a boy who was killed last year." "I'm awfully sorry." "He was a very nice boy. He was going to marry me and he was killed in the Somme." "It was a ghastly show." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 19 "Were you there ?" "No." * "I've heard about it," she said. "There's not really any war of that sort down here. They sent me the little stick. His mother sent it to me. They returned it with his things." "Had you been engaged long?" "Eight years. We grew up together." "And why didn't you marry?" "I don't know," she said. "I was a fool not to. I could have given him that anyway. But I thought it would be bad for him." 1 see. "Have you ever loved any one?" "No," I said We sat down on a bench and I looked at her. "You have beautiful hair," I said. "Do you like it?" "Very much." "I was going to cut it all off when he died." "No." "I wanted to do something for him. You see I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or any- thing. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know." I did not say anything. "I didn't know about anything then. I thought it would be worse for him. I thought perhaps he couldn't stand it and then of course he was killed and that was the end of it." "I don't know." "Oh, yes," she said. "That's the end of it." 20 A FAREWELL TO ARMS We looked at Rinaldi talking with the other nurse. "What is her name?" "Ferguson. Helen Ferguson. Your friend is a doc- tor, isn't he?" "Yes. He's very good." "That's splendid You rarely find any one any good this close to the front. This is close to the front, isn't it?" "Quite." "It's a silly front," she said. "But it's very beauti- ful. Are they going to have an offensive?" "Yes." "Then we'll have to work. There's no work now." "Have you done nursing long?" "Since the end of 'fifteen. I started when he did. I remember having a silly idea he might come to the hospital where I was. With a sabre cut, I suppose, and a bandage around his head. Or shot through the shoul- der. Something picturesque." "This is the picturesque front," I said. "Yes," she said. "People can't realize what France is like. If they did, it couldn't all go on. He didn't have a sabre cut. They blew him all to bits." I didn't say anything. "Do you suppose it will always go on?" "No." "What's to stop it?" "It will crack somewhere." "We'll crack. We'll crack in France. They can't go on doing things like the Somme and not crack." "They won't crack here," I said. "You think not?" "No. They did very well last summer." "They may crack," she said. "Anybody may crack." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 21 "The Germans too." "No," she said. "I think not." We went over toward Rinaldi and Miss Ferguson. "You love Italy?" Rinaldi asked Miss Ferguson in English. "Quite well." "No understand," Rinaldi shook his head. "Abbastanza bene," I translated. He shook his head. "That is not good. You love England?" "Not too well. I'm Scotch, you see." Rinaldi looked at me blankly. "She's Scotch, so she loves Scotland better than Eng- land," I said in Italian. "But Scotland is England." I translated this for Miss Ferguson. "Pas encore," said Miss Ferguson. "Not really?" "Never. We do not like the English." "Not like the English? Not like Miss Barkley?" "Oh, that's different. You mustn't take everything so literally." After a while we said good-night and left. Walking home Rinaldi said, "Miss Barkley prefers you to me. That is very clear. But the little Scotch one is very nice." "Very," I said. I had not noticed her. "You like her?" "No," said Rinaldi. CHAPTER V The next afternoon I went to call on Miss Barkley again. She was not in the garden and I went to the side door of the villa where the ambulances drove up. Inside I saw the head nurse, who said Miss Barkley was on duty â€” "there's a war on, you know." I said I knew. "You're the American in the Italian army?" she asked. "Yes, ma'am." "How did you happen to do that? Why didn't you join up with us ?" "I don't know," I said. "Could I join now?" "I'm afraid not now. Tell me. Why did you join up with the Italians?" "I was in Italy," I said, "and I spoke Italian." "Oh," she said. "I'm learning it It's a beautiful language." "Somebody said you should be able to learn it in two weeks." "Oh, I'll not learn it in two weeks. I've studied it for months now. You may come and see her after seven o'clock if you wish. She'll be off then. But don't bring a lot of Italians." "Not even for the beautiful language?" "No. Nor for the beautiful uniforms." "Good evening," I said. "A rivederci, Tenente." "A rivederla." I saluted and went out. It was im- possible to salute foreigners as an Italian, without em- A FAREWELL TO ARMS 23 barrassment The Italian salute never seemed made for export. The day had been hot. I had been up the river to the bridgehead at Plava. It was there that the offensive was to begin. It had been impossible to advance on the far side the year before because there was only one road leading down from the pass to the pontoon bridge and it was under machine-gun and shell fire for nearly a mile. It was not wide enough either to carry all the trans- port for an offensive and the Austrians could make a shambles out of it. But the Italians had crossed and spread out a little way on the far side to hold about a mile and a half on the Austrian side of the river. It was a nasty place and the Austrians should not have let them hold it. I suppose it was mutual tolerance because the Austrians still kept a bridgehead further down the river. The Austrian trenches were above on the hillside only a few yards from the Italian lines. There had been a little town but it was all rubble. There was what was left of a railway station and a smashed permanent bridge that could not be repaired and used because it was in plain sight. I went along the narrow road down toward the river, left the car at the dressing station under the hill, crossed the pontoon bridge, which was protected by a shoulder of the mountain, and went through the trenches in the smashed-down town and along the edge of the slope. Everybody was in the dugouts. There were racks of rockets standing to be touched oflf to call for help from the artillery or to signal with if the tele- phone "wires were cut. It was quiet, hot and dirty. I looked across the wire at the Austrian lines. Nobody was in sight. I had a drink with a captain that I knew in one of the dugouts and went back across the bridge. 24 A FAREWELL TO ARMS A new wide road was being finished that would go over the mountain and zig-zag down to the bridge. When this road was finished the offensive would start. It came down through the forest in sharp turns. The system was to bring everything down the new road and take the empty trucks, carts and loaded ambulances and all returning traffic up the old narrow road. The dress- ing station was on the Austrian side of the river under the edge of the hill and stretcher-bearers would bring the wounded back across the pontoon bridge. It would be the same when the offensive started. As far as I could make out the last mile or so of the new road where it started to level out would be able to be shelled steadily by the Austrians. It looked as though it might be a mess. But I found a place where the cars would be sheltered after they had passed that last bad-looking bit and could wait for the wounded to be brought across the pontoon bridge. I would have liked to drive over the new road but it was not yet finished. It looked wide and well made with a good grade and the turns looked very impressive where you could see them through openings in the forest on the mountain side. The cars would be all right with their good metal-to-metal brakes and anyway, coming down, they would not be loaded. I drove back up the narrow road. Two carabinieri held the car up. A shell had fallen and while we waited three others fell up the road. They were seventy-sevens and came with a whishing rush of air, a hard bright burst and flash and then gray smoke that blew across the road. The carabinieri waved us to go on. Passing where the shells had landed I avoided the small broken places and smelled the high explosive and the smell of blasted clay and stone and freshly shattered flint. I drove back to Gorizia and our villa A FAREWELL TO ARMS 25 and, as I said, went to call on Miss Barkley, who was on duty. At dinner I ate very quickly and left for the villa where the British had their hospital. It was really very large and beautiful and there were fine trees in the grounds. Miss Barkley was sitting on a bench in the garden. Miss Ferguson was with her. They seemed glad to see me and in a little while Miss Ferguson excused herself and went away. "I'll leave you two," she said. "You get along very well without me." "Don't go, Helen," Miss Barkley said. *Td really rather. I must write some letters." "Good-night," I said. "Good-night, Mr. Henry." "Don't write anything that will bother the censor." "Don't worry. I only write about what a beautiful place we live in and how brave the Italians are." "That way you'll be decorated." "That will be nice. Good-night, Catherine." "I'll see you in a little while," Miss Barkley said. Miss Ferguson walked away in the dark. "She's nice," I said. "Oh, yes, she's very nice. She's a nurse." "Aren't you a nurse?" "Oh, no. I'm something called a V. A. D. We work very hard but no one trusts us." "Why not?" "They don't trust us when there's nothing going on. When there is really work they trust us." "What is the difference?" "A nurse is like a doctor. It takes a long time to be. A V. A. D. is a short cut." "I see." 26 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "The Italians didn't want women so near the front. So we're all on very special behavior. We don't go out." "I can come here though." "Oh, yes. We're not cloistered." "Let's drop the war." "It's very hard. There's no place to drop it." "Let's drop it anyway." "All right." We looked at each other in the dark. I thought she was very beautiful and I took her hand. She let me take it and I held it and put my arm around under her arm. "No," she said. I kept my arm where it was. "Why not?" "No." "Yes," I said. "Please." I leaned forward in the dark to kiss her and there was a sharp stinging flash. She had slapped my face hard. Her hand had hit my nose and eyes, and tears came in my eyes from the reflex. "I'm so sorry," she said. I felt I had a certain ad- vantage. "You were quite right." "I'm dreadfully sorry," she said. "I just couldn't stand the nurse' s-evening-off aspect of it. I didn't mean to hurt you. I did hurt you, didn't I ?" She was looking at me in the dark. I was angry and yet certain, seeing it all ahead like the moves in a chess game. "You did exactly right," I said. "I don't mind at all." "Poor man." "You see I've been leading a sort of a funny life. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 27 And I never even talk English. And then you are so very beautiful/' I looked at her. "You don't need to say a lot of nonsense. I said I was sorry. We do get along." "Yes/' I said. "And we have gotten away from the war." She laughed. It was the first time I had ever heard her laugh. I watched her face. "You are sweet," she said. "No, I'm not." "Yes. You are a dear. I'd be glad to kiss you if you don't mind." I looked in her eyes and put my arm around her as I had before and kissed her. I kissed her hard and held her tight and tried to open her lips; they were closed tight. I was still angry and as I held her suddenly she shivered. I held her close against me and could fed her heart beating and her lips opened and her head went back against my hand and then she was crying on my shoulder. "Oh, darling," she said. "You will be good to me, won't you?" What the hell, I thought. I stroked her hair and patted her shoulder. She was crying. "You will, won't you?" She looked up at me. "Be- cause we're going to have a strange life." After a while I walked with her to the door of the villa and she went in and I walked home. Back at the villa I went upstairs to the room. Rinaldi was lying on his bed. He looked at me. "So you make progress with Miss Barkley?" "We are friends." "You have that pleasant air of a dog in heat." I did not understand the word. 28 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Of a what?" He explained. "You," I said, "have that pleasant air of a dog whoâ€”" "Stop it," he said. "In a little while we would say insulting things." He laughed. "Good-night," I said. "Good-night, little puppy." I knocked over his candle with the pillow and got into bed in the dark. Rinaldi picked up the candle, lit it and went on reading. CHAPTER VI I was away for two days at the posts. When I got home it was too late and I did not see Miss Barkley until the next evening. She was not in the garden and I had to wait in the office of the hospital until she came down. There were many marble busts on painted wooden pillars along the walls of the room they used for an office. The hall too, that the office opened on, was lined with them. They had the complete marble quality of all looking alike. Sculpture had always seemed a dull business â€” still, bronzes looked like some- thing. But marble busts all looked like a cemetery. There was one fine cemetery though â€” the one at Pisa. Genoa was the place to see the bad marbles. This had been the villa of a very wealthy German and the busts must have cost him plenty. I wondered who had done them and how much he got. I tried to make out whether they were members of the family or what; but they were all uniformly classical. You could not tell anything about them. I sat on a chair and held my cap. We were supposed to wear steel helmets even in Gorizia but they were un- comfortable and too bloody theatrical in a town where the civilian inhabitants had not been evacuated. I wore one when we went up to the posts and carried an Eng- lish gas mask. We were just beginning to get some of them. They were a real mask. Also we were required to wear an automatic pistol ; even doctors and sanitary officers. I felt it against the back of the chair. You 3o A FAREWELL TO ARMS were liable to arrest if you did not have one worn in plain sight. Rinaldi carried a holster stuffed with toilet paper. I wore a real one and felt like a gunman until I practised firing it. It was an Astra 7.65 caliber with a short barrel and it jumped so sharply when you let it off that there was no question of hitting anything. I practised with it, holding below the target and trying to master the jerk of the ridiculous short barrel until I could hit within a yard of where I aimed at twenty paces and then the ridiculousness of carrying a pistol at all came over me and I soon forgot it and carried it flopping against the small of my back with no feeling at all except a vague sort of shame when I met English- speaking people. I sat now in the chair and an orderly of some sort looked at me disapprovingly from behind a desk while I looked at the marble floor, the pillars with the marble busts, and the frescoes on the wall and waited for Miss Barkley. The frescoes were not bad. Any frescoes were good when they started to peel and flake off. I saw Catherine Barkley coming down the hall, and stood up. She did not seem tall walking toward me but she looked very lovely. "Good-evening, Mr. Henry," she said. "How do you do?" I said. The orderly was listening behind the desk. "Shall we sit here or go out in the garden?" "Let's go out. It's much cooler." I walked behind her out into the garden, the orderly looking after us. When we were out on the gravel drive she said, "Where have you been?" "I've been out on post." "You couldn't have sent me a note?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 31 "No/* I said. "Not very well. I thought I was com- ing back." "You ought to have let me know, darling.' f We were off the driveway, walking under the trees. I took her hands, then stopped and kissed her. "Isn't there anywhere we can go?" "No," she said. "We have to just walk here. You've been away a long time." "This is the third day. But I'm back now." She looked at me, "And you do love me ?" "Yes." "You did say you loved me, didn't you?" "Yes," I lied. "I love you." I had not said it before. "And you call me Catherine ?" "Catherine." We walked on a way and were stopped under a tree. "Say, T've come back to Catherine in the night.' " "I've come back to Catherine in the night." "Oh, darling, you have come back, haven't you?" "Yes." "I love you so and it's been awful. You won't go away?" "No. I'll always come back." "Oh, I love you so. Please put your hand there again." "It's not been away." I turned her so I could see her face when I kissed her and I saw that her eyes were shut. I kissed both her shut eyes. I thought she was probably a little crazy. It was all right if she was. I did not care what I was getting into. This was better than going every evening to the house for officers where the girls climbed all over you and put your cap on back- 32 A FAREWELL TO ARMS ward as a sign of affection between their trips upstairs with brother officers. I knew I did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards. Like bridge you had to pretend you were playing for money or playing for some stakes. Nobody had mentioned what the stakes were. It was all right with me. "I wish there was some place we could go," I said. I was experiencing the masculine difficulty of making love very long standing up. "There isn't any place," she said. She came back from wherever she had been. "We might sit there just for a little while." We sat on the flat stone bench and I held Catherine Barkley's hand. She would not let me put my arm around her. "Are you very tired?" she asked. "No." She looked down at the grass. "This is a rotten game we play, isn't it?" "What game?" "Don't be dull." "I'm not, on purpose." "You're a nice boy," she said. "And you play it as well as you know how. But it's a rotten game." "Do you always know what people think?" "Not always. But I do with you. You don't have to pretend you love me. That's over for the evening. Is there anything you'd like to talk about?" "But I do love you." "Please let's not lie when we don't have to. I had a very fine little show and I'm all right now. You see A FAREWELL TO ARMS 33 I'm not mad and I'm not gone off. It's only a little sometimes." I pressed her hand, "Dear Catherine." "It sounds very funny now â€” Catherine. You don't pronounce it very much alike. But you're very nice. You're a very good boy." "That's what the priest said." "Yes, you're very good. And you will come and see me?" "Of course." "And you don't have to say you love me. That's all over for a while." She stood up and put out her hand. "Good-night." I wanted to kiss her. "No," she said. "I'm awfully tired." "Kiss me, though," I said. "I'm awfully tired, darling." "Kiss me." "Do you want to very much?" "Yes." We kissed and she broke away suddenly. "No. Good-night, please, darling." We walked to the door and I saw her go in and down the hall. I liked to watch her move. She went on down the hall. I went on home. It was a hot night and there was a good deal going on up in the mountains. I watched the flashes on San Gabriele. I stopped in front of the Villa Rossa. The shutters were up but it was still going on inside. Somebody was singing. I went on home. Rinaldi came in while I was undressing. "Ah, ha!" he said. "It does not go so well. Baby is puzzled." "Where have you been?" 34 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "At the Villa Rossa. It was very edifying, baby. We all sang. Where have you been?" "Calling on the British." "Thank God I did not become involved with the British." CHAPTER VII I came back the next afternoon from our first moun- tain post and stopped the car at the smistimento where the wounded and sick were sorted by their papers and the papers marked for the different hospitals. I had been driving and I sat in the car and the driver took the papers in. It was a hot day and the sky was very bright and blue and the road was white and dusty. I sat in the high seat of the Fiat and thought about nothing. A regiment went by in the road and I watched them pass. The men were hot and sweating. Some wore their steel helmets but most of them carried them slung from their packs. Most of the helmets were too big and came down almost over the ears of the men who wore them. The officers all wore helmets ; better-fitting helmets. It was half of the brigata Basilicata. I identified them by their red and white striped collar mark. There were stragglers going by long after the regiment had passed - â€” men who could not keep up with their platoons. They were sweaty, dusty and tired. Some looked pretty bad. A soldier came along after the last of the stragglers. He was walking with a limp. He stopped and sat down beside the road. I got down and went over. "What's the matter ?" He looked at me, then stood up. "I'm going on." "What's the trouble?" " the war." "What's wrong with your leg?" "It's not my leg. I got a rupture." 35 36 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Why don't you ride with the transport ?" I asked. "Why don't you go to the hospital?" "They won't let me. The lieutenant said I slipped the truss on purpose." "Let me feel it." "It's way out." "Which side is it on?" "Here." I felt it. "Cough," I said. "I'm afraid it will make it bigger. It's twice as big as it was this morning." "Sit down," I said. "As soon as I get the papers on these wounded I'll take you along the road and drop you with your medical officers." "He'll say I did it on purpose." "They can't do anything," I said. "It's not a wound. You've had it before, haven't you?" "But I lost the truss." "They'll send you to a hospital." "Can't I stay here, Tenente?" "No, I haven't any papers for you." The driver came out of the door with the papers for the wounded in the car. "Four for 105. Two for 132," he said. They were hospitals beyond the river. "You drive," I said. I helped the soldier with the rupture up on the seat with us. "You speak English?" he asked. "Sure." "How you like this goddam war?" "Rotten." "I say it's rotten. Jesus Christ, I say it's rotten." "Were you in the States?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 37 "Sure. In Pittsburg. I knew you was an Ameri- can." "Don't I talk Italian good enough?" "I knew you was an American all right." "Another American," said the driver in Italian look- ing at the hernia man. "Listen, lootenant. Do you have to take me to that regiment?" "Yes." "Because the captain doctor knew I had this rupture. I threw away the goddam truss so it would get bad and I wouldn't have to go to the line again." I see. "Couldn't you take me no place else?" "If it was closer to the front I could take you to a first medical post. But back here you've got to have papers." "If I go back they'll make me get operated on and then they'll put me in the line all the time." I thought it over. "You wouldn't want to go in the line all the time, would you?" he asked. "No." "Jesus Christ, ain't this a goddam war?" "Listen," I said. "You get out and fall down by the road and get a bump on your head and I'll pick you up on our way back and take you to a hospital. We'll stop by the road here, Aldo." We stopped at the side of the road. I helped him down. "I'll be right here, lieutenant," he said. "So long," I said. We went on and passed the regi- ment about a mile ahead, then crossed the river, cloudy with snow-water and running fast through the spiles of the bridge, to ride along the road across the plain 38 A FAREWELL TO ARMS and deliver the wounded at the two hospitals. I drove coming back and went fast with the empty car to find the man from Pittsburg. First we passed the regiment, hotter and slower than ever : then the stragglers. Then we saw a horse ambulance stopped by the road. Two men were lifting the hernia man to put him in. They had come back for him. He shook his head at me. His helmet was off and his forehead was bleeding below the hair line. His nose was skinned and there was dust on the bloody patch and dust in his hair. "Look at the bump, lieutenant !" he shouted. "Noth- ing to do. They come back for me." When I got back to the villa it was five o'clock and I went out where we washed the cars, to take a shower. Then I made out my report in my room, sitting in my trousers and an undershirt in front of the open win- dow. In two days the offensive was to start and I would go with the cars to Plava. It was a long time since I had written to the States and I knew I should write but I had let it go so long that it was almost im- possible to write now. There was nothing to write about. I sent a couple of army Zona di Guerra post- cards, crossing out everything except, I am well. That should handle them. Those post-cards would be very fine in America; strange and mysterious. This was a strange and mysterious war zone but I supposed it was quite well run and grim compared to other wars with the Austrians. The Austrian army was created to give Napoleon victories ; any Napoleon. I wished we had a Napoleon, but instead we had II Generale Cadorna, fat and prosperous, and Vittorio Emmanuele, the tiny man with the long thin neck and the goat beard. Over on the right they had the Duke of Aosta. Maybe he A FAREWELL TO ARMS 39 was too good-looking to be a great general but he looked like a man. Lots of them would have liked him to be king. He looked like a king. He was the King's uncle and commanded the third army. We were in the second army. There were some British batteries up with the third army. I had met two gunners from that lot, in Milan. They were very nice and we had a big evening. They were big and shy and embarrassed and very ap- preciative together of anything that happened. I wish that I was with the British. It would have been much simpler. Still I would probably have been killed. Not in this ambulance business. Yes, even in the ambulance business. British ambulance drivers were killed some- times. Well, I knew I would not be killed. Not in this war. It did not have anything to do with me. It seemed no more dangerous to me myself than war in the movies. I wished to God it was over though. Maybe it would finish this summer. Maybe the Aus- trians would crack. They had always cracked in other wars. What was the matter with this war? Every- body said the French were through. Rinaldi said that the French had mutinied and troops marched on Paris. I asked him what happened and he said, "Oh, they stopped them." I wanted to go to Austria without war. I wanted to go to the Black Forest. I wanted to go to the Hartz Mountains. Where were the Hartz Moun- tains anyway? They were fighting in the Carpathians. I did not want to go there anyway. It might be good though. I could go to Spain if there was no war. The sun was going down and the day was cooling off. After supper I would go and see Catherine Barkley. I wished she were here now. I wished I were in Milan with her. I would like to eat at the Cova and then walk down the Via Manzoni in the hot evening and cross over and 4 o A FAREWELL TO ARMS turn off along the canal and go to the hotel with Cath- erine Barkley. Maybe she would. Maybe she would pretend that I was her boy that was killed and we would go in the front door and the porter would take off his cap and I would stop at the concierge's desk and ask for the key and she would stand by the elevator and then we would get in the elevator and it would go up very slowly clicking at all the floors and then our floor and the boy would open the door and stand there and she would step out and I would step out and we would walk down the hall and I would put the key in the door and open it and go in and then take down the telephone and ask them to send a bottle of capri bianca in a silver bucket full of ice and you would hear the ice against the pail coming down the corridor and the boy would knock and I would say leave it outside the door please. Because we would not wear any clothes because it was so hot and the window open and the swallows flying over the roofs of the houses and when it was dark afterward and you went to the window very small bats hunting over the houses and close down over the trees and we would drink the capri and the door locked and it hot and only a sheet and the whole night and we would both love each other all night in the hot night in Milan. That was how it ought to be. I would eat quickly and go and see Catherine Barkley. They talked too much at the mess and I drank wine because to-night we were not all brothers unless I drank a little and talked with the priest about Archbishop Ireland who was, it seemed, a noble man and with whose injustice, the injustices he had received and in which I participated as an American, and of which I had never heard, I feigned acquaintance. It would have been im- polite not to have known something of them when I had A FAREWELL TO ARMS 4 i listened to such a splendid explanation of their causes which were, after all, it seemed, misunderstandings. I thought he had a fine name and he came from Minne- sota which made a lovely name : Ireland of Minnesota, Ireland of Wisconsin, Ireland of Michigan. What made it pretty was that it sounded like Island. No that wasn't it. There was more to it than that. Yes, father. That is true, father. Perhaps, father. No, father. Well, maybe yes, father. You know more about it than I do, father. The priest was good but dull. The officers were not good but dull. The King was good but dull. The wine was bad but not dull. It took the enamel off your teeth and left it on the roof of your mouth. "And the priest was locked up," Rocca said, "be- cause they found the three per cent bonds on his person. It was in France of course. Here they would never have arrested him. He denied all knowledge of the five per cent bonds. This took place at Beziers. I was there and reading of it in the paper, went to the jail and asked to see the priest. It was quite evident he had stolen the bonds." "I don't believe a word of this," Rinaldi said. "Just as you like," Rocca said. "But I am telling it for our priest here. It is very informative. He is a priest; he will appreciate it." The priest smiled. "Go on," he said. "I am listen- ing." "Of course some of the bonds were not accounted for but the priest had all of the three per cent bonds and several local obligations, I forget exactly what they were. So I went to the jail, now this is the point of the story, and I stood outside his cell and I said as though I were going to confession, 'Bless me, father, for you have sinned/ " 42 A FAREWELL TO ARMS There was great laughter from everybody. "And what did he say?" asked the priest. Rocca ignored this and went on to explain the joke to me. "You see the point, don't you?" It seemed it was a very funny joke if you understood it properly. They poured me more wine and I told the story about the English private soldier who was placed under the show- er bath. Then the major told the story of the eleven Czecho-slovaks and the Hungarian corporal. After some more wine I told the story of the jockey who found the penny. The major said there was an Italian story something like that about the duchess who could not sleep at night. At this point the priest left and I told the story about the travelling salesman who arrived at five o'clock in the morning at Marseilles when the mistral was blowing. The major said he had heard a report that I could drink. I denied this. He said it was true and by the corpse of Bacchus we would test whether it was true or not. Not Bacchus, I said. Not Bacchus. Yes, Bacchus, he said. I should drink cup for cup and glass for glass with Bassi, Fillipo Vin- cenza. Bassi said no that was no test because he had already drunk twice as much as I. I said that was a foul lie and, Bacchus or no Bacchus, Fillipo Vincenza Bassi or Bassi Fillippo Vicenza had never touched a drop all evening and what was his name anyway? He said was my name Frederico Enrico or Enrico Feder- ico ? I said let the best man win, Bacchus barred, and the major started us with red wine in mugs. Half-way through the wine I did not want any more. I remem- bered where I was going. "Bassi wins," I said. "He's a better man than I am. I have to go." "He does really," said Rinaldi. "He has a rendezvous. I know all about it." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 43 "I have to go." "Another night," said Bassi. "Another night when you feel stronger." He slapped me on the shoulder. There were lighted candles on the table. All the officers were very happy. "Good-night, gentlemen," I said. Rinaldi went out with me. We stood outside the door on the patch and he said, "You'd better not go up there drunk." "Fm not drunk, Rinin. Really." "You'd better chew some coffee." "Nonsense." "I'll get some, baby. You walk up and down." He came back with a handful of roasted coffee beans, "Chew those, baby, and God be with you." "Bacchus," I said. "I'll walk down with you." "I'm perfectly all right." We walked along together through the town and I chewed the coffee. At the gate of the driveway that led up to the British villa, Rinaldi said good-night. "Good-night," I said. "Why don't you come in?" He shook his head. "No," he said, "I like the sim- pler pleasures." "Thank you for the coffee beans." "Nothing, baby. Nothing." I started down the driveway. The outlines of the cypresses that lined it were sharp and clear. I looked back and saw Rinaldi standing watching me and waved to him. I sat in the reception hall of the villa, waiting for Catherine Barkley to come down. Some one was com- ing down the hall-way. I stood up, but it was not Catherine. It was Miss Ferguson. "Hello," she said. "Catherine asked me to tell you she was sorry she couldn't see you this evening." 44 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "I'm so sorry. I hope she's not ill." "She's not awfully well." "Will you tell her how sorry I am?" "Yes, I will." "Do you think it would be any good to try and see her to-morrow ?" "Yes, I do." "Thank you very much," I said. "Good-night." I went out the door and suddenly I felt lonely and empty. I had treated seeing Catherine very lightly, I had gotten somewhat drunk and had nearly forgotten to come but when I could not see her there I was feel- ing lonely and hollow. CHAPTER VIII The next afternoon we heard there was to be an at- tack up the river that night and that we were to take four cars there. Nobody knew anything about it al- though they all spoke with great positiveness and stra- tegical knowledge. I was riding in the first car and as we passed the entry to the British hospital I told the driver to stop. The other cars pulled up. I got out and told the driver to go on and that if we had not caught up to them at the junction of the road to Cormons to wait there. I hurried up the driveway and inside the reception hall I asked for Miss Barkley. "She's on duty." "Could I see her just for a moment ?" They sent an orderly to see and she came back with him. "I stopped to ask if you were better. They told me you were on duty, so I asked to see you." "I'm quite well," she said, "I think the heat knocked me over yesterday." "I have to go." "I'll just step out the door a minute." "And you're all right ?" I asked outside. "Yes, darling. Are you coming to-night?" "No. I'm leaving now for a show up above Plava." "A show?" "I don't think it's anything." "And you'll be back?" "To-morrow." She was unclasping something from her neck. She 45 46 A FAREWELL TO ARMS put it in my hand. "It's a Saint Anthony," she said. "And come to-morrow night." "You're not a Catholic, are you?" "No. But they say a Saint Anthony's very useful." "I'll take care of him for you. Good-by." "No," she said, "not good-by." "All right." "Be a good boy and be careful. No, you can't kiss me here. You can't." "All right." I looked back and saw her standing on the steps. She waved and I kissed my hand and held it out. She waved again and then I was out of the driveway and climbing up into the seat of the ambulance and we started. The Saint Anthony was in a little white metal capsule. I opened the capsule and spilled him out into my hand. "Saint Anthony?" asked the driver. "Yes." "I have one." His right hand left the wheel and opened a button on his tunic and pulled it out from un- der his shirt. "See?" I put my Saint Anthony back in the capsule, spilled the thin gold chain together and put it all in my breast pocket. "You don't wear him ?" "No." "It's better to wear him. That's what it's for." "All right," I said. I undid the clasp of the gold chain and put it around my neck and clasped it. The saint hung down on the outside of my uniform and I undid the throat of my tunic, unbuttoned the shirt col- lar and dropped him in under the shirt. I felt him in A FAREWELL TO ARMS 47 his metal box against my chest while we drove. Then I forgot about him. After I was wounded I never found him. Some one probably got it at one of the dressing stations. We drove fast when we were over the bridge and soon we saw the dust of the other cars ahead down the road. The road curved and we saw the three cars look- ing quite small, the dust rising from the wheels and go- ing off through the trees. We caught them and passed them and turned off on a road that climbed up into the hills. Driving in convoy is not unpleasant if you are the first car and I settled back in the seat and watched the country. We were in the foot-hills on the near side of the river and as the road mounted there were the high mountains off to the north with snow still on the tops. I looked back and saw the three cars all climb- ing, spaced by the interval of their dust. We passed a long column of loaded mules, the drivers walking along beside the mules wearing red fezzes. They were ber- saglieri. Beyond the mule train the road was empty and we climbed through the hills and then went down over the shoulder of a long hill into a river-valley. There were trees along both sides of the road and through the right line of trees I saw the river, the water clear, fast and shallow. The river was low and there were stretches of sand and pebbles with a narrow channel of water and sometimes the water spread like a sheen over the pebbly bed. Close to the bank I saw deep pools, the water blue like the sky. I saw arched stone bridges over the river where tracks turned off from the road and we passed stone farmhouses with pear trees can- delabraed against their south walls and low stone walls in the fields. The road went up the valley a long way 48 A FAREWELL TO ARMS and then we turned off and commenced to climb into the hills again. The road climbed steeply going up and back and forth through chestnut woods to level finally along a ridge. I could look down through the woods and see, far below, with the sun on it, the line of the river that separated the two armies. We went along the rough new military road that followed the crest of the ridge and I looked to the north at the two ranges of moun- tains, green and dark to the snow-line and then white and lovely in the sun. Then, as the road mounted along the ridge, I saw a third range of mountains, higher snow mountains, that looked chalky white and fur- rowed, with strange planes, and then there were moun- tains far off beyond all these that you could hardly tell if you really saw. Those were all the Austrians* moun- tains and we had nothing like them. Ahead there was a rounded turn-off in the road to the right and looking down I could see the road dropping through the trees. There were troops on this road and motor trucks and mules with mountain guns and as we went down, keep- ing to the side, I could see the river far down below, the line of ties and rails running along it, the old bridge where the railway crossed to the other side and across, under a hill beyond the river, the broken houses of the little town that was to be taken. It was nearly dark when we came down and turned onto the main road that ran beside the river. CHAPTER IX The road was crowded and there were screens of corn-stalk and straw matting on both sides and matting over the top so that it was like the entrance at a circus or a native village. We drove slowly in this matting- covered tunnel and came out onto a bare cleared space where the railway station had been. The road here was below the level of the river bank and all along the side of the sunken road there were holes dug in the bank with infantry in them. The sun was going down and looking up along the bank as we drove I saw the Aus- trian observation balloons above the hills on the other side dark against the sunset. We parked the cars be- yond a brickyard. The ovens and some deep holes had been equipped as dressing stations. There were three doctors that I knew. I talked with the major and learned that when it should start and our cars should be loaded we would drive them back along the screened road and up to the main road along the ridge where there would be a post and other cars to clear them. He hoped the road would not jam. It was a one-road show. The road was screened because it was in sight of the Austrians across the river. Here at the brickyard we were sheltered from rifle or machine-gun fire by the river bank. There was one smashed bridge across the river. They were going to put over another bridge when the bombardment started and some troops were to cross at the shallows up above at the bend of the river. The major was a little man with upturned mus- taches. He had been in the war in Libya and wore two wound-stripes. He said that if the thing went well he 49 So A FAREWELL TO ARMS would see that I was decorated. I said I hoped it would go well but that he was too kind. I asked him if there was a big dugout where the drivers could stay and he sent a soldier to show me. I went with him and found the dugout, which was very good. The drivers were pleased with it and I left them there. The major asked me to have a drink with him and two other officers. We drank rum and it was very friendly. Outside it was get- ting dark. I asked what time the attack was to be and they said as soon as it was dark. I went back to the drivers. They were sitting in the dugout talking and when I came in they stopped. I gave them each a pack- age of cigarettes, Macedonias, loosely packed ciga- rettes that spilled tobacco and needed to have the ends twisted before you smoked them. Manera lit his lighter and passed it around. The lighter was shaped like a Fiat radiator. I told them what I had heard. "Why didn't we see the post when we came down?'' Passini asked. "It was just beyond where we turned off." "That road will be a dirty mess," Manera said. "They'll shell the out of us." "Probably." "What about eating, lieutenant? We won't get a chance to eat after this thing starts." "Fll go and see now," I said. "You want us to stay here or can we look around ?" "Better stay here." I went back to the major's dugout and he said the field kitchen would be along and the drivers could come and get their stew. He would loan them mess tins if they did not have them. I said I thought they had them. I went back and told the drivers I would get them as soon as the food came. Manera said he hoped it would come before A FAREWELL TO ARMS 51 the bombardment started. They were silent until I went out. They were all mechanics and hated the war. I went out to look at the cars and see what was going on and then came back and sat down in the dugout with the four drivers. We sat on the ground with our backs against the wall and smoked. Outside it was nearly dark. The earth of the dugout was warm and dry and I let my shoulders back against the wall, sitting on the small of my back, and relaxed. "Who goes to the attack ?" asked Gavuzzi. "Bersaglieri." "All bersaglieri?" "I think so." "There aren't enough troops here for a real attack." "It is probably to draw attention from where the real attack will be." "Do the men know that who attack?" "I don't think so." "Of course they don't," Manera said. "They wouldn't attack if they did." "Yes they would," Passini said. "Bersaglieri are fools." "They are brave and have good discipline," I said. "They are big through the chest by measurement, and healthy. But they are still fools." "The granatieri are tall," Manera said. This was a joke. They all laughed. "Were you there, Tenente, when they wouldn't at- tack and they shot every tenth man?" "No." "It is true. They lined them up afterward and took every tenth man. Carabinieri shot them." "Carabinieri," said Passini and spat on the floor. 52 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "But those grenadiers ; all over six feet. They wouldn't attack." "If everybody would not attack the war would be over," Manera said. "It wasn't that way with the granatieri. They were afraid. The officers all came from such good families." "Some of the officers went alone." "A sergeant shot two officers who would not get out." "Some troops went out" "Those that went out were not lined up when they took the tenth men." "One of those shot by the carabinieri is from my town," Passini said. "He was a big smart tall boy to be in the granatieri. Always in Rome. Always with the girls. Always with the carabinieri." He laughed. "Now they have a guard outside his house with a bayo- net and nobody can come to see his mother and father and sisters and his father loses his civil rights and can- not even vote. They are all without law to protect them. Anybody can take their property." "If it wasn't that that happens to their families no- body would go to the attack." "Yes. Alpini would. These V. E. soldiers would. Some bersaglieri." "Bersaglieri have run too. Now they try to forget it." "You should not let us talk this way, Tenente. Ev- viva 1'esercito," Passini said sarcastically. "I know how you talk," I said. "But as long as you drive the cars and behave " " â€” and don't talk so other officers can hear," Manera finished. "I believe we should get the war over," I said. "It A FAREWELL TO ARMS 53 would not finish it if one side stopped fighting. It would only be worse if we stopped fighting/' "It could not be worse," Passini said respectfully. "There is nothing worse than war." "Defeat is worse." "I do not believe it," Passini said still respectfully. "What is defeat? You go home." "They come after you. They take your home. They take your sisters." "I don't believe it," Passini said. "They can't do that to everybody. Let everybody defend his home. Let them keep their sisters in the house." "They hang you. They come and make you be a soldier again. Not in the auto-ambulance, in the in- fantry." "They can't hang every one." "An outside nation can't make you be a soldier," Manera said. "At the first battle you all run." "Like the Tchecos." "I think you do not know anything about being con- quered and so you think it is not bad." "Tenente," Passini said. "We understand you let us talk. Listen. There is nothing as bad as war. We in the auto-ambulance cannot even realize at all how bad it is. When people realize how bad it is they cannot do anything to stop it because they go crazy. There are some people who never realize. There are people who are afraid of their officers. It is with them that war is made." "I know it is bad but we must finish it." "It doesn't finish. There is no finish to a war." "Yes there is." Passini shook his head. "War is not won by victory. What if we take San 54 A FAREWELL TO ARMS Gabriele? What if we take the Carso and Monfalcone and Trieste? Where are we then? Did you see all the far mountains to-day? Do you think we could take all them too? Only if the Austrians stop fighting. One side must stop fighting. Why don't we stop fighting? If they come down into Italy they will get tired and go away. They have their own country. But no, in- stead there is a war." "You're an orator/' "We think. We read. We are not peasants. We are mechanics. But even the peasants know better than to believe in a war. Everybody hates this war." "There is a class that controls a country that is stupid and does not realize anything and never can. That is why we have this war." "Also they make money out of it." "Most of them don't," said Passini. "They are too stupid. They do it for nothing. For stupidity." "We must shut up," said Manera. "We talk too much even for the Tenente." "He likes it," said Passini. "We will convert him." "But now we will shut up," Manera said. "Do we eat yet, Tenente?" Gavuzzi asked. "I will go and see," I said. Gordini stood up and went outside with me. "Is there anything I can do, Tenente? Can I help in any way?" He was the quietest one of the four. "Come with me if you want," I said, "and we'll see." It was dark outside and the long light from the search-lights was moving over the mountains. There were big search-lights on that front mounted on cami- ons that you passed sometimes on the roads at night, close behind the lines, the camion stopped a little off the road, an officer directing the light and the crew scared. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 55 We crossed the brickyard, and stopped at the main dressing station. There was a little shelter of green branches outside over the entrance and in the dark the night wind rustled the leaves dried by the sun. Inside there was a light. The major was at the telephone sit- ting on a box. One of the medical captains said the at- tack had been put forward an hour. He offered me a glass of cognac. I looked at the board tables, the in- struments shining in the light, the basins and the stop- pered bottles. Gordini stood behind me. The major got up from the telephone. "It starts now," he said. "It has been put back again." I looked outside, it was dark and the Austrian search- lights were moving on the mountains behind us. It was quiet for a moment still, then from all the guns behind us the bombardment started. "Savoia," said the major. "About the soup, major," I said. He did not hear me. I repeated it. "It hasn't come up." A big shell came in and burst outside in the brick- yard. Another burst and in the noise you could hear the smaller noise of the brick and dirt raining down. "What is there to eat?" "We have a little pasta asciutta," the major said. "I'll take what you can give me." The major spoke to an orderly who went out of sight in the back and came back with a metal basin of cold cooked macaroni. I handed it to Gordini. "Have you any cheese?" The major spoke grudgingly to the orderly who ducked back into the hole again and came out with a quarter of a white cheese. 56 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Thank you very much," I said. "You'd better not go out." Outside something was set down beside the entrance. One of the two men who had carried it looked in. "Bring him in," said the major. "What's the matter with you? Do you want us to come outside and get him?" The two stretcher-bearers picked up the man under the arms and by the legs and brought him in. "Slit the tunic," the major said. He held a forceps with some gauze in the end. The two captains took off their coats. "Get out of here," the major said to the two stretcher-bearers. "Come on," I said to Gordini. "You better wait until the shelling is over," the ma- jor said over his shoulder. "They want to eat," I said. "As you wish." Outside we ran across the brickyard. A shell burst short near the river bank. Then there was one that we did not hear coming until the sudden rush. We both went flat and with the flash and bump of the burst and the smell heard the singing off of the fragments and the rattle of falling brick. Gordini got up and ran for the dugout. I was after him, holding the cheese, its smooth surface covered with brick dust. Inside the dugout were the three drivers sitting against the wall, smoking. "Here, you patriots," I said. "How are the cars?" Manera asked. "All right." "Did they scare you, Tenente?" "You're damned right," I said. I took out my knife, opened it, wiped off the blade A FAREWELL TO ARMS 57 and pared off the dirty outside surface of the cheese. Gavuzzi handed me the basin of macaroni. "Start in to eat, Tenente." "No," I said. "Put it on the floor. We'll all eat." "There are no forks." "What the hell," I said in English. I cut the cheese into pieces and laid them on the macaroni. "Sit down to it," I said. They sat down and waited. I put thumb and fingers into the macaroni and lifted. A mass loosened. "Lift it high, Tenente." I lifted it to arm's length and the strands cleared. I lowered it into the mouth, sucked and snapped in the ends, and chewed, then took a bite of cheese, chewed, and then a drink of the wine. It tasted of rusty metal. I handed the canteen back to Passini. "It's rotten/' he said. "It's been in there too long. I had it in the car." They were all eating, holding their chins close over the basin, tipping their heads back, sucking in the ends. I took another mouthful and some cheese and a rinse of wine. Something landed outside that shook the earth. "Four hundred twenty or minnenwerfer," Gavuzzi said. "There aren't any four hundred twenties in the mountains," I said. "They have big Skoda guns. I've seen the holes." "Three hundred fives." We went on eating. There was a cough, a noise like a railway engine starting and then an explosion that shook the earth again. "This isn't a deep dugout," Passini said. "That was a big trench mortar." 58 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Yes, sir." I ate the end of my piece of cheese and took a swal- low of wine. Through the other noise I heard a cough, then came the chuh-chuh-chuh-chuh â€” then there was a flash, as when a blast-furnace door is swung open, and a roar that started white and went red and on and on in a rushing wind. I tried to breathe but my breath would not come and I felt myself rush bodily out of myself and out and out and out and all the time bodily in the wind. I went out swiftly, all of myself, and I knew I was dead and that it had all been a mistake to think you just died. Then I floated, and instead of going on I felt myself slide back. I breathed and I was back. The ground was torn up and in front of my head there was a splintered beam of wood. In the jolt of my head I heard somebody crying. I thought somebody was screaming. I tried to move but I could not move. I heard the machine-guns and rifles firing across the river and all along the river. There was a great splashing and I saw the star-shells go up and burst and float whitely and rockets going up and heard the bombs, all this in a moment, and then I heard close to me some one saying "Mama Mia! Oh, mama Mia!" I pulled and twisted and got my legs loose finally and turned around and touched him. It was Passini and when I touched him he screamed. His legs were toward me and I saw in the dark and the light that they were both smashed above the knee. One leg was gone and the other was held by tendons and part of the trouser and the stump twitched and jerked as though it were not connected. He bit his arm and moaned, "Oh mama mia, mama Mia," then, "Dio te salve, Maria. Dio te salve, Maria. Oh Jesus shoot me Christ shoot me mama mia mama Mia oh purest lovely Mary shoot me. Stop it. Stop it. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 59 Stop it. Oh Jesus lovely Mary stop it. Oh oh oh oh," then choking, "Mama mama mia." Then he was quiet, biting his arm, the stump of his leg twitching. "Porta feriti I" I shouted holding my hands cupped. "Porta Feriti I" I tried to get closer to Passini to try to put a tourniquet on the legs but I could not move. I tried again and my legs moved a little. I could pull backward along with my arms and elbows. Passini was quiet now. I sat beside him, undid my tunic and tried to rip the tail of my shirt. It would not rip and I bit the edge of the cloth to start it. Then I thought of his puttees. I had on wool stockings but Passini wore puttees. All the drivers wore puttees but Passini had only one leg. I unwound the puttee and while I was doing it I saw there was no need to try and make a tourniquet because he was dead already. I made sure he was dead. There were three others to locate. I sat up straight and as I did so something inside my head moved like the weights on a doll's eyes and it hit me inside in back of my eyeballs. My legs felt warm and wet and my shoes were wet and warm inside. I knew that I was hit and leaned over and put my hand on my knee. My knee wasn't there. My hand went in and my knee was down on my shin. I wiped my hand on my shirt and another floating light came very slowly down and I looked at my leg and was very afraid. Oh, God, I said, get me out of here. I knew, however, that there had been three others. There were four drivers. Passini was dead. That left three. Some one took hold of me under the arms and somebody else lifted my legs. "There are three others," I said. "One is dead." "It's Manera. We went for a stretcher but there wasn't any. How are you, Tenente?" 60 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Where is Gordini and Gavuzzi?" "Gordini's at the post getting bandaged. Gavuzzi has your legs. Hold on to my neck, Tenente. Are you badly hit?" "In the leg. How is Gordini?" "He's all right. It was a big trench mortar shell." "Passings dead." "Yes. He's dead." A shell fell close and they both dropped to the ground and dropped me. "I'm sorry, Tenente," said Manera. "Hang onto my neck." "If you drop me again." "It was because we were scared." "Are you unwounded?" "We are both wounded a little." "Can Gordini drive?" "I don't think so." They dropped me once more before we reached the post. "You sons of bitches," I said. "I am sorry, Tenente," Manera said. "We won't drop you again." Outside the post a great many of us lay on the ground in the dark. They carried wounded in and brought them out. I could see the light come out from the dressing station when the curtain opened and they brought some one in or out. The dead were off to one side. The doctors were working with their sleeves up to their shoulders and were red as butchers. There were not enough stretchers. Some of the wounded were noisy but most were quiet. The wind blew the leaves in the bower over the door of the dressing sta- tion and the night was getting cold. Stretcher-bearers A FAREWELL TO ARMS 61 came in all the time, put their stretchers down, un- loaded them and went away. As soon as I got to the dressing station Manera brought a medical sergeant out and he put bandages on both my legs. He said there was so much dirt blown into the wound that there had not been much hemorrhage. They would take me as soon as possible. He went back inside. Gordini could not drive, Manera said. His shoulder was smashed and his head was hurt. He had not felt bad but now the shoulder had stiffened. He was sitting up beside one of the brick walls. Manera and Gavuzzi each went off with a load of wounded. They could drive all right. The British had come with three ambulances and they had two men on each ambulance. One of their drivers came over to me, brought by Gordini who looked very white and sick. The Britisher leaned over. "Are you hit badly ?" he asked. He was a tall man and wore steel-rimmed spectacles. "In the legs. ,, "It's not serious I hope. Will you have a cigarette ?" "Thanks." "They tell me you've lost two drivers. ,, "Yes. One killed and the fellow that brought you." "What rotten luck. Would you like us to take the cars?" "That's what I wanted to ask you." "We'd take quite good care of them and return them to the Villa. 206 aren't you?" "Yes." "It's a charming place. I've seen you about. They tell me you're an American." "Yes." "I'm English." 62 A FAREWELL TO ARMS u Nor "Yes, English. Did you think I was Italian? There were some Italians with one of our units." "It would be fine if you would take the cars," I said. "We'll be most careful of them," he straightened up. "This chap of yours was very anxious for me to see you." He patted Gordini on the shoulder. Gordini winced and smiled. The Englishman broke into voluble and perfect Italian. "Now everything is arranged. I've seen your Tenente. We will take over the two cars. You won't worry now." He broke off, "I must do something about getting you out of here. I'll see the medical wallahs. We'll take you back with us." He walked across to the dressing station, stepping carefully among the wounded. I saw the blanket open, the light came out and he went in. "He will look after you, Tenente," Gordini said. "How are you, Franco?" "I am all right." He sat down beside me. In a moment the blanket in front of the dressing station opened and two stretcher-bearers came out followed by the tall Englishman. He brought them over to me. "Here is the American Tenente," he said in Italian. "I'd rather wait," I said. "There are much worse wounded than me. I'm all right." "Come come," he said. "Don't be a bloody hero." Then in Italian: "Lift him very carefully about the legs. His legs are very painful. He is the legitimate son of President Wilson." They picked me up and took me into the dressing room. Inside they were oper- ating on all the tables. The little major looked at us furious. He recognized me and waved a forceps. "Qavabien?" "Ca va." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 63 "I have brought him in," the tall Englishman said in Italian. "The only son of the American Ambassador. He can be here until you are ready to take him. Then I will take him with my first load." He bent over me. "I'll look up their adjutant to do your papers and it will all go much faster." He stooped to go under the door- way and went out. The major was unhooking the for- ceps now, dropping them in a basin. I followed his hands with my eyes. Now he was bandaging. Then the stretcher-bearers took the man off the table. "I'll take the American Tenente," one of the captains said. They lifted me onto the table. It was hard and slippery. There were many strong smells, chemical smells and the sweet smell of blood. They took off my trousers and the medical captain commenced dictating to the sergeant-adjutant while he worked, "Multiple superficial wounds of the left and right thigh and left and right knee and right foot. Profound wounds of right knee and foot. Lacerations of the scalp (he probed â€” Does that hurt? â€” Christ, yes!) with pos- sible fracture of the skull. Incurred in the line of duty. That's what keeps you from being court-martialled for self-inflicted wounds," he said. "Would you like a drink of brandy? How did you run into this thing anyway? What were you trying to do ? Commit suicide ? Anti- tetanus please, and mark a cross on both legs. Thank you. I'll clean this up a little, wash it out, and put on a dressing. Your blood coagulates beautifully." The adjutant, looking up from the paper, "What in- flicted the wounds ?" The medical captain, "What hit you ?" Me, with the eyes shut, "A trench mortar shell." The captain, doing things that hurt sharply and severing tissue â€” "Are you sure?" 64 A FAREWELL TO ARMS Me â€” trying to lie still and feeling my stomach flut- ter when the flesh was cut, "I think so." Captain doctor â€” (interested in something he was finding), "Fragments of enemy trench-mortar shell. Now I'll probe for some of this if you like but it's not necessary. Til paint all this and â€” Does that sting? Good, that's nothing to how it will feel later. The pain hasn't started yet. Bring him a glass of brandy. The shock dulls the pain ; but this is all right, you have noth- ing to worry about if it doesn't infect and it rarely does now. How is your head?" "Good Christ!" I said. "Better not drink too much brandy then. If you've got a fracture you don't want inflammation. How does that feel?" Sweat ran all over me. "Good Christ!" I said. "I guess you've got a fracture all right. I'll wrap you up and don't bounce your head around." He band- aged, his hands moving very fast and the bandage coming taut and sure. "All right, good luck and Vive la France." "He's an American," one of the other captains said. "I thought you said he was a Frenchman. He talks French," the captain said. "I've known him before. I always thought he was French." He drank a half tumbler of cognac. "Bring on something serious. Get some more of that Anti-tetanus." The captain waved to me. They lifted me and the blanket-flap went across my face as we went out. Outside the sergeant-adjutant knelt down beside me where I lay, "Name?" he asked softly. "Middle name? First name? Rank? Where born? What class? What corps?" and so on. "I'm A FAREWELL TO ARMS 65 sorry for your head, Tenente. I hope you feel better. I'm sending you now with the English ambulance.' ' "Frri all right," I said. 'Thank you very much." The pain that the major had spoken about had started and all that was happening was without interest or rela- tion. After a while the English ambulance came up and they put me onto a stretcher and lifted the stretcher up to the ambulance level and shoved it in. There was another stretcher by the side with a man on it whose nose I could see, waxy-looking, out of the bandages. He breathed very heavily. There were stretchers lifted and slid into the slings above. The tall English driver came around and looked in, "I'll take it very easily," he said. "I hope you'll be comfy." I felt the engine start, felt him climb up into the front seat, felt the brake come off and the clutch go in, then we started. I lay still and let the pain ride. As the ambulance climbed along the road, it was slow in the traffic, sometimes it stopped, sometimes it backed on a turn, then finally it climbed quite fast. I felt something dripping. At first it dropped slowly and reg- ularly, then it pattered into a stream. I shouted to the driver. He stopped the car and looked in through the hole behind his seat. "What is it?" "The man on the stretcher over me has a hemor- rhage." "We're not far from the top. I wouldn't be able to get the stretcher out alone." He started the car. The stream kept on. In the dark I could not see where it came from the canvas overhead. I tried to move side- ways so that it did not fall on me. Where it had run down under my shirt it was warm and sticky. I was cold and my leg hurt so that it made me sick. After a 66 A FAREWELL TO ARMS while the stream from the stretcher above lessened and started to drip again and I heard and felt the canvas above move as the man on the stretcher settled more comfortably. "How is he?" the Englishman called back. "We're almost up." "He's dead I think," I said. The drops fell very slowly, as they fall from an icicle after the sun has gone. It was cold in the car in the night as the road climbed. At the post on the top they took the stretcher out and put another in and we went on. CHAPTER X In the ward at the field hospital they told me a visitor was coming to see me in the afternoon. It was a hot day and there were many flies in the room. My orderly had cut paper into strips and tied the strips to a stick to make a brush that swished the flies away. I watched them settle on the ceiling. When he stopped swishing and fell asleep they came down and I blew them away and finally covered my face with my hands and slept too. It was very hot and when I woke my legs itched. I waked the orderly and he poured mineral water on the dressings. That made the bed damp and cool. Those of us that were awake talked across the ward. The after- noon was a quiet time. In the morning they came to each bed in turn, three men nurses and a doctor and picked you up out of bed and carried you into the dressing room so that the beds could be made while we were having our wounds dressed. It was not a pleasant trip to the dressing room and I did not know until later that beds could be made with men in them. My orderly had finished pouring water and the bed felt cool and lovely and I was telling him where to scratch on the soles of my feet against the itching when one of the doctors brought in Rinaldi. He came in very fast and bent down over the bed and kissed me. I saw he wore gloves. "How are you, baby? How do you feel? I bring you this â€” " It was a bottle of cognac. The orderly brought a chair and he sat down, "and good news. You will be decorated. They want to get you the 67 68 A FAREWELL TO ARMS medaglia d'argento but perhaps they can get only the bronze." "What for?" "Because you are gravely wounded. They say if you can prove you did any heroic act you can get the silver. Otherwise it will be the bronze. Tell me exactly what happened. Did you do any heroic act?" "No," I said. "I was blown up while we were eating cheese." "Be serious. You must have done something heroic either before or after. Remember carefully." "I did not." "Didn't you carry anybody on your back? Gordini says you carried several people on your back but the medical major at the first post declares it is impossible. He has to sign the proposition for the citation." "I didn't carry anybody. I couldn't move." "That doesn't matter," said Rinaldi. He took off his gloves. "I think we can get you the silver. Didn't you re- fuse to be medically aided before the others?" "Not very firmly." "That doesn't matter. Look how you are wounded. Look at your valorous conduct in asking to go always to the first line. Besides, the operation was successful." "Did they cross the river all right?" "Enormously. They take nearly a thousand pris- oners. It's in the bulletin. Didn't you see it?" "No." "I'll bring it to you. It is a successful coup de main." "How is everything?" "Splendid. We are all splendid. Everybody is proud of you. Tell me just exactly how it happened. I am positive you will get the silver. Go on tell me. Tell me A FAREWELL TO ARMS 69 all about it." He paused and thought. "Maybe you will get an English medal too. There was an English there. I'll go and see him and ask if he will recommend you. He ought to be able to do something. Do you suffer much? Have a drink. Orderly, go get a corkscrew. Oh you should see what I did in the removal of three metres of small intestine and better now than ever. It is one for The Lancet. You do me a translation and I will send it to The Lancet. Every day I am better. Poor dear baby, how do you feel ? Where is that damn corkscrew ? You are so brave and quiet I forget you are suffering." He slapped his gloves on the edge of the bed. "Here is the corkscrew, Signor Tenente," the order- ly said. "Open the bottle. Bring a glass. Drink that, baby. How is your poor head ? I looked at your papers. You haven't any fracture. That major at the first post was a hog-butcher. I would take you and never hurt you. I never hurt anybody. I learn how to do it. Every day I learn to do things smoother and better. You must forgive me for talking so much, baby. I am very moved to see you badly wounded. There, drink that. It's good. It cost fifteen lire. It ought to be good. Five stars. After I leave here I'll go see that English and he'll get you an English medal." "They don't give them like that." "You are so modest. I will send the liaison officer. He can handle the English." "Have you seen Miss Barkley?" "I will bring her here. I will go now and bring her here." "Don't go," I said. "Tell me about Gorizia. How are the girls?" 70 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "There are no girls. For two weeks now they haven't changed them. I don't go there any more. It is dis- graceful. They aren't girls; they are old war com- rades/' "You don't go at all?" "I just go to see if there is anything new. I stop by. They all ask for you. It is a disgrace that they should stay so long that they become friends." "Maybe girls don't want to go to the front any more." "Of course they do. They have plenty of girls. It is just bad administration. They are keeping them for the pleasure of dugout hiders in the rear." "Poor Rinaldi," I said. "All alone at the war with no new girls." Rinaldi poured himself another glass of the cognac. "I don't think it will hurt you, baby. You take it." I drank the cognac and felt it warm all the way down. Rinaldi poured another glass. He was quieter now. He held up the glass. "To your valorous wounds. To the silver medal. Tell me, baby, when you lie here all the time in the hot weather don't you get excited ?" "Sometimes." "I can't imagine lying like that. I would go crazy." "You are crazy." "I wish you were back. No one to come in at night from adventures. No one to make fun of. No one to lend me money. No blood brother and roommate. Why do you get yourself wounded?" "You can make fun of the priest." "That priest. It isn't me that makes fun of him. It is the captain. I like him. If you must have a priest have that priest. He's coming to see you. He makes big preparations." "I like him." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 71 "Oh, I knew it. Sometimes I think you and he are a little that way. You know." "No, you don't." "Yes, I do sometimes. A little that way like the num- ber of the first regiment of the Brigata Ancona." "Oh, go to hell." He stood up and put on his gloves. "Oh I love to tease you, baby. With your priest and your English girl, and really you are just like me under- neath." "No, I'm not." "Yes, we are. You are really an Italian. All fire and smoke and nothing inside. You only pretend to be American. We are brothers and we love each other." "Be good while I'm gone," I said. "I will send Miss Barkley. You are better with her without me. You are purer and sweeter." "Oh, go to hell." "I will send her. Your lovely cool goddess. English goddess. My God what would a man do with a woman like that except worship her ? What else is an English- woman good for ?" "You are an ignorant foul-mouthed dago." "A what?" "An ignorant wop." "Wop. You are a frozen-faced . . . wop." "You are ignorant. Stupid." I saw that word pricked him and kept on. "Uninformed. Inexperi- enced, stupid from inexperience." "Truly? I tell you something about your good wo- men. Your goddesses. There is only one difference be- tween taking a girl who has always been good and a woman. With a girl it is painful. That's all I know." 72 A FAREWELL TO ARMS He slapped the bed with his glove. "And you never know if the girl will really like it" "Don't get angry." "I'm not angry. I just tell you, baby, for your own good. To save you trouble." "That's the only difference?" "Yes. But millions of fools like you don't know it." "You were sweet to tell me." "We won't quarrel, baby. I love you too much. But don't be a fool." "No. I'll be wise like you." "Don't be angry, baby. Laugh. Take a drink. I must go, really." "You're a good old boy." "Now you see. Underneath we are the same. We are war brothers. Kiss me good-by." "You're sloppy." "No. I am just more affectionate." I felt his breath come toward me. "Good-by. I come to see you again soon." His breath went away. "I won't kiss you if you don't want. I'll send your English girl. Good-by, baby. The cognac is under the bed. Get well soon." He was gone. CHAPTER XI It was dusk when the priest came. They had brought the soup and afterward taken away the bowls and I was lying looking at the rows of beds and out the win- dow at the tree-top that moved a little in the evening breeze. The breeze came in through the window and it was cooler with the evening. The flies were on the ceil- ing now and on the electric light bulbs that hung on wires. The lights were only turned on when some one was brought in at night or when something was being done. It made me feel very young to have the dark come after the dusk and then remain. It was like being put to bed after early supper. The orderly came down between the beds and stopped. Some one was with him. It was the priest. He stood there small, brown-faced, and embarrassed. "How do you do?" he asked. He put some packages down by the bed, on the floor. "All right, father." He sat down in the chair that had been brought for Rinaldi and looked out of the window embarrassedly. I noticed his face looked very tired. "I can only stay a minute," he said. "It is late." "It's not late. How is the mess?" He smiled. "I am still a great joke," he sounded tired too. "Thank God they are all well." "I am so glad you are all right," he said. "I hope you don't suffer." He seemed very tired and I was not used to seeing him tired. "Not any more." "I miss you at the mess:" 73 74 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "I wish I were there. I always enjoyed our talk- ing." "I brought you a few little things/' he said. He picked up the packages. "This is mosquito netting. This is a bottle of vermouth. You like vermouth? These are English papers." "Please open them." He was pleased and undid them. I held the mosquito netting in my hands. The vermouth he held up for me to see and then put it on the floor beside the bed. I held up one of the sheaf of English papers. I could read the headlines by turning it so the half-light from the window was on it. It was The News of the World. "The others are illustrated," he said. "It will be a great happiness to read them. Where did you get them?" "I sent for them to Mestre. I will have more." "You were very good to come, father. Will you drink a glass of vermouth?" "Thank you. You keep it. It's for you." "No, drink a glass." "All right. I will bring you more then." The orderly brought the glasses and opened the bot- tle. He broke off the cork and the end had to be shoved down into the bottle. I could see the priest was dis- appointed but he said, "That's all right. It's no mat- ter." "Here's to your health, father." "To your better health." Afterward he held the glass in his hand and we looked at one another. Sometimes we talked and were good friends but to-night it was difficult. "What's the matter, father? You seem very tired." "I am tired but I have no right to be." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 75 "It's the heat." "No. This is only the Spring. I feel very low." "You have the war disgust." "No. But I hate the war." "I don't enjoy it," I said. He shook his head and looked out of the window. "You do not mind it. You do not see it. You must forgive me. I know you are wounded." "That is an accident." "Still even wounded you do not see it. I can tell. I do not see it myself but I feel it a little." "When I was wounded we were talking about it. Passini was talking." The priest put down the glass. He was thinking about something else. "I know them because I am like they are," he said. "You are different though." "But really I am like they are." "The officers don't see anything." "Some of them do. Some are very delicate and feel worse than any of us." "They are mostly different." "It is not education or money. It is something else. Even if they had education or money men like Passini would not wish to be officers. I would not be an officer." "You rank as an officer. I am an officer." "I am not really. You are not even an Italian. You are a foreigner. But you are nearer the officers than you are to the men." "What is the difference?" "I cannot say it easily. There are people who would make war. In this country there are many like that. There are other people who would not make war." 76 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "But the first ones make them do it." "Yes." "And I help them." "You are a foreigner. You are a patriot." "And the ones who would not make war? Can they stop it?" "I do not know." He looked out of the window again. I watched his face. "Have they ever been able to stop it?" "They are not organized to stop things and when they get organized their leaders sell them out." "Then it's hopeless?" "It is never hopeless. But sometimes I cannot hope. I try always to hope but sometimes I cannot." "Maybe the war will be over." "I hope so." "What will you do then?" "If it is possible I will return to the Abruzzi." His brown face was suddenly very happy. "You love the Abruzzi !" "Yes, I love it very much." "You ought to go there then." "I would be too happy. If I could live there and love God and serve Him." "And be respected," I said. "Yes and be respected. Why not ?" "No reason not. You should be respected." "It does not matter. But there in my country it is understood that a man may love God. It is not a dirty joke." "I understand." He looked at me and smiled. "You understand but you do not love God." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 77 "No." "You do not love Him at all?" he asked. "I am afraid of him in the night sometimes." "You should love Him." "I don't love much." "Yes," he said. "You do. What you tell me about in the nights. That is not love. That is only passion and lust. When you love you wish to do things for. You wish to sacrifice for. You wish to serve." "I don't love." "You will. I know you will. Then you will be happy." "I'm happy. I've always been happy." "It is another thing. You cannot know about it un- less you have it." "Well," I said. "If I ever get it I will tell you." "I stay too long and talk too much." He was wor- ried that he really did. "No. Don't go. How about loving women? If I really loved some woman would it be like that?" "I don't know about that. I never loved any woman." "What about your mother?" "Yes, I must have loved my mother." "Did you always love God?" "Ever since I was a little boy." "Well," I said. I did not know what to say. "You are a fine boy," I said. "I am a boy," he said. "But you call me father." "That's politeness." He smiled. "I must go, really," he said. "You do not want me for anything?" he asked hopefully. "No. Just to talk." "I will take your greetings to the mess." 78 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 'Thank you for the many fine presents." "Nothing." "Come and see me again." "Yes. Good-by," he patted my hand. "So long," I said in dialect. "Ciaou," he repeated. It was dark in the room and the orderly, who had sat by the foot of the bed, got up and went out with him. I liked him very much and I hoped he would get back to the Abruzzi some time. He had a rotten life in the mess and he was fine about it but I thought how he would be in his own country. At Capracotta, he had told me, there were trout in the stream below the town. It was forbidden to play the flute at night. When the young men serenaded only the flute was forbidden. Why, I had asked. Because it was bad for the girls to hear the flute at night. The peasants all called you "Don" and when you met them they took off their hats. His father hunted every day and stopped to eat at the houses of peasants. They were always honored. For a foreigner to hunt he must present a certificate that he had never been arrested. There were bears on the Gran Sasso D'ltalia but it was a long way. Aquila was a fine town. It was cool in the summer at night and the spring in Abruzzi was the most beautiful in Italy. But what was lovely was the fall to go hunting through the chestnut woods. The birds were all good because they fed on grapes and you never took a lunch because the peasants were always honored if you would eat with them at their houses. After a while I went to sleep. CHAPTER XII The room was long with windows on the right-hand side and a door at the far end that went into the dress- ing room. The row of beds that mine was in faced the windows and another row, under the windows, faced the wall. If you lay on your left side you could see the dressing-room door. There was another door at the far end that people sometimes came in by. If any one were going to die they put a screen around the bed so you could not see them die, but only the shoes and puttees of doctors and men nurses showed under the bottom of the screen and sometimes at the end there would be whispering. Then the priest would come out from be- hind the screen and afterward the men nurses would go back behind the screen to come out again carrying the one who was dead with a blanket over him down the corridor between the beds and some one folded the screen and took it away. That morning the major in charge of the ward asked me if I felt that I could travel the next day. I said I could. He said then they would ship me out early in the morning. He said I would be better off making the trip now before it got too hot. When they lifted you up out of bed to carry you into the dressing room you could look out of the window and see the new graves in the garden. A soldier sat out- side the door that opened onto the garden making crosses and painting on them the names, rank, and regi- ment of the men who were buried in the garden. He also ran errands for the ward and in his spare time made me a cigarette lighter out of an empty Austrian 79 80 A FAREWELL TO ARMS rifle cartridge. The doctors were very nice and seemed very capable. They were anxious to ship me to Milan where there were better X-ray facilities and where, af- ter the operation, I could take mechanotherapy. I wanted to go to Milan too. They wanted to get us all out and back as far as possible because all the beds were needed for the offensive, when it should start The night before I left the field hospital Rinaldi came in to see me with the major from our mess. They said that I would go to an American hospital in Milan that had just been installed. Some American ambulance units were to be sent down and this hospital would look after them and any other Americans on service in Italy. There were many in the Red Cross. The States had de- clared war on Germany but not on Austria. The Italians were sure America would declare war on Austria too and they were very excited about any Americans coming down, even the Red Cross. They asked me if I thought President Wilson would declare war on Austria and I said it was only a matter of days. I did not know what we had against Austria but it seemed logical that they should declare war on her if they did on Germany. They asked me if we would declare war on Turkey. I said that was doubtful. Turkey, I said, was our national bird but the joke trans- lated so badly and they were so puzzled and suspicious that I said yes, we would probably declare war on Tur- key. And on Bulgaria? We had drunk several glasses of brandy and I said yes by God on Bulgaria too and on Japan. But, they said, Japan is an ally of England. You can't trust the bloody English. The Japanese want Hawaii, I said. Where is Hawaii ? It is in the Pacific Ocean. Why do the Japanese want it ? They don't real- ly want it, I said. That is all talk. The Japanese are a A FAREWELL TO ARMS 81 wonderful little people fond of dancing and light wines. Like the French, said the major. We will get Nice and Savoia from the French. We will get Corsica and all the Adriatic coast-line, Rinaldi said. Italy will return to the splendors of Rome, said the major. I don't like Rome, I said. It is hot and full of fleas. You don't like Rome ? Yes, I love Rome. Rome is the mother of nations. I will never forget Romulus suckling the Tiber. What ? Nothing. Let's all go to Rome. Let's go to Rome to-night and never come back. Rome is a beautiful city, said the major. The mother and father of nations, I said. Roma is feminine, said Rinaldi. It cannot be the father. Who is the father, then, the Holy Ghost ? Don't blaspheme. I wasn't blaspheming, I was asking for information. You are drunk, baby. Who made me drunk? I made you drunk, said the major. I made you drunk because I love you and because America is in the war. Up to the hilt, I said. You go away in the morning, baby, Rinaldi said. To Rome, I said. No, to Milan. To Milan, said the major, to the Crystal Palace, to the Cova, to Campari's, to Biffi's, to the galleria. You lucky boy. To the Gran Italia I said, where I will borrow money from George. To the Scala, said Rinaldi. You will go to the Scala. Every night, I said. You won't be able to afford it every night, said the major. The tickets are very expensive. I will draw a sight draft on my grandfather, I said. A what? A sight draft. He has to pay or I go to jail. Mr. Cunningham at the bank does it. I live by sight drafts. Can a grand- father jail a patriotic grandson who is dying that Italy may live ? Live the American Garibaldi, said Rinaldi. Viva the sight drafts, I said. We must be quiet, said the major. Already we have been asked many times to 82 A FAREWELL TO ARMS be quiet. Do you go to-morrow really, Federico ? He goes to the American hospital I tell you, Rinaldi said. To the beautiful nurses. Not the nurses with beards of the field hospital. Yes, yes, said the major, I know he goes to the American hospital. I don't mind their beards, I said. If any man wants to raise a beard let him. Why don't you raise a beard, Signor Maggiore? It could not go in a gas mask. Yes it could. Anything can go in a gas mask. I've vomited into a gas mask. Don't be so loud, baby, Rinaldi said. We all know you have been at the front. Oh, you fine baby, what will I do while you are gone? We must go, said the major. This becomes sentimental. Listen, I have a surprise for you. Your English. You know? The English you go to see every night at their hospital? She is going to Milan too. She goes with another to be at the Ameri- can hospital. They had not got nurses yet from Amer- ica. I talked to-day with the head of their riparto. They have too many women here at the front. They send some back. How do you like that, baby? All right. Yes ? You go to live in a big city and have your English there to cuddle you. Why don't I get wounded ? Maybe you will, I said. We must go, said the major. We drink and make noise and disturb Federico. Don't go. Yes, we must go. Good-by. Good luck. Many things. Ciaou. Ciaou. Ciaou. Come back quickly, baby. Rinaldi kissed me. You smell of lysol. Good- by, baby. Good-by. Many things. The major patted my shoulder. They tiptoed out. I found I was quite drunk but went to sleep. The next day in the morning we left for Milan and arrived forty-eight hours later. It was a bad trip. We were sidetracked for a long time this side of Mestre A FAREWELL TO ARMS 83 and children came and peeked in. I got a little boy to go for a bottle of cognac but he came back and said he could only get grappa. I told him to get it and when it came I gave him the change and the man beside me and I got drunk and slept until past Vicenza where I woke up and was very sick on the floor. It did not matter because the man on that side had been very sick on the floor several times before. Afterward I thought I could not stand the thirst and in the yards outside of Verona I called to a soldier who was walking up and down beside the train and he got me a drink of water. I woke Georgetti, the other boy who was drunk, and of- fered him some water. He said to pour it on his shoul- der and went back to sleep. The soldier would not take the penny I offered him and brought me a pulpy orange. I sucked on that and spit out the pith and watched the soldier pass up and down past a freight-car outside and after a while the train gave a jerk and started. BOOK II CHAPTER XIII We got into Milan early in the morning and they unloaded us in the freight yard. An ambulance took me to the American hospital. Riding in the ambulance on a stretcher I could not tell what part of town we were passing through but when they unloaded the stretcher I saw a market-place and an open wine shop with a girl sweeping out. They were watering the street and it smelled of the early morning. They put the stretcher down and went in. The porter came out with them. He had gray mustaches, wore a doorman's cap and was in his shirt sleeves. The stretcher would not go into the elevator and they discussed whether it was better to lift me off the stretcher and go up in the elevator or carry the stretcher up the stairs. I listened to them discussing it. They decided on the elevator. They lifted me from the stretcher. "Go easy," I said. "Take it softly." In the elevator we were crowded and as my legs bent the pain was very bad. "Straighten out the legs," I said. "We can't, Signor Tenente. There isn't room." The man who said this had his arm around me and my arm was around his neck. His breath came in my face me- tallic with garlic and red wine. "Be gentle," the other man said. "Son of a bitch who isn't gentle !" "Be gentle I say," the man with my feet repeated. I saw the doors of the elevator closed, and the grill shut and the fourth-floor button pushed by the porter. 87 88 A FAREWELL TO ARMS The porter looked worried. The elevator rose slowly. "Heavy?" I asked the man with the garlic. "Nothing," he said. His face was sweating and he grunted. The elevator rose steadily and stopped. The man holding the feet opened the door and stepped out. We were on a balcony. There were several doors with brass knobs. The man carrying the feet pushed a but- ton that rang a bell. We heard it inside the doors. No one came. Then the porter came up the stairs. "Where are they?" the stretcher-bearers asked. "I don't know," said the porter. "They sleep down stairs." "Get somebody." The porter rang the bell, then knocked on the door, then he opened the door and went in. When he came back there was an elderly woman wearing glasses with him. Her hair was loose and half- falling and she wore a nurse's dress. "I can't understand," she said. "I can't understand Italian." "I can speak English," I said. "They want to put me somewhere." "None of the rooms are ready. There isn't any pa- tient expected." She tucked at her hair and looked at me near-sightedly. "Show them any room where they can put me." "I don't know," she said. "There's no patient ex- pected. I couldn't put you in just any room." "Any room will do," I said. Then to the porter in Italian, "Find an empty room." "They are all empty," said the porter. "You are the first patient." He held his cap in his hand and looked at the elderly nurse. "For Christ's sweet sake take me to some room." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 89 The pain had gone on and 99 with the legs bent and I could feel it going in and out of the bone. The porter went in the door, followed by the gray-haired woman, then came hurrying back. "Follow me," he said. They carried me down a long hallway and into a room with drawn blinds. It smelled of new furniture. There was a bed and a big wardrobe with a mirror. They laid me down on the bed. "I can't put on sheets/' the woman said. "The sheets are locked up." I did not speak to her. "There is money in my pocket," I said to the porter. "In the buttoned-down pocket." The porter took out the money. The two stretcher-bearers stood beside the bed holding their caps. "Give them five lire apiece and five lire for your- self. My papers are in the other pocket You may give them to the nurse." The stretcher-bearers saluted and said thank you. "Good-by," I said. "And many thanks." They saluted again and went out. "Those papers," I said to the nurse, "describe my case and the treatment already given." The woman picked them up and looked at them through her glasses. There were three papers and they were folded. "I don't know what to do," she said. "I can't read Italian. I can't do anything without the doctor's orders." She commenced to cry and put the papers in her apron pocket. "Are you an American?" she asked crying. "Yes. Please put the papers on the table by the bed." It was dim and cool in the room. As I lay on the bed I could see the big mirror on the other side of the room but could not see what it reflected. The porter stood by the bed. He had a nice face and was very kind. 9 o A FAREWELL TO ARMS "You can go," I said to him. "You can go too," I said to the nurse. "What is your name?" "Mrs. Walker." "You can go, Mrs. Walker. I think I will go to sleep." I was alone in the room. It was cool and did not smell like a hospital. The mattress was firm and com- fortable and I lay without moving, hardly breathing, happy in feeling the pain lessen. After a while I wanted a drink of water and found the bell on a cord by the bed and rang it but nobody came. I went to sleep. When I woke I looked around. There was sunlight coming in through the shutters. I saw the big armoire, the bare walls, and two chairs. My legs in the dirty bandages, stuck straight out in the bed. I was careful not to move them. I was thirsty and I reached for the bell and pushed the button. I heard the door open and looked and it was a nurse. She looked young and pretty. "Good-morning," I said. "Good-morning," she said and came over to the bed. "We haven't been able to get the doctor. He's gone to Lake Como. No one knew there was a patient coming. What's wrong with you anyway?" "I'm wounded. In the legs and feet and my head is hurt." "What's your name?" "Henry. Frederic Henry." "I'll wash you up. But we can't do anything to the dressings until the doctor comes." "Is Miss Barkley here?" "No. There's no one by that name here." "Who was the woman who cried when I came in?" The nurse laughed. "That's Mrs. Walker. She was A FAREWELL TO ARMS 91 on night duty and she'd been asleep. She wasn't ex- pecting any one." While we were talking she was undressing me, and when I was undressed, except for the bandages, she washed me, very gently and smoothly. The washing felt very good. There was a bandage on my head but she washed all around the edge. "Where were you wounded?" "On the Isonzo north of Plava." "Where is that?" "North of Gorizia." I could see that none of the places meant anything to her. "Do you have a lot of pain?" "No. Not much now." She put a thermometer in my mouth. "The Italians put it under the arm," I said. "Don't talk." When she took the thermometer out she read it and then shook it. "What's the temperature?" "You're not supposed to know that" "Tell me what it is." "It's almost normal." "I never have any fever. My legs are full of old iron too." "What do you mean?" "They're full of trench-mortar fragments, old screws and bed-springs and things." She shook her head and smiled. "If you had any foreign bodies in your legs they would set up an inflammation and you'd have fever." "All right," I said. "We'll see what â‚¬omes out." She went out of the room and came back with the 92 A FAREWELL TO ARMS old nurse of the early morning. Together they made the bed with me in it. That was new to me and an admirable proceeding. "Who is in charge here?" "Miss Van Campen." "How many nurses are there?" "Just us two." "Won't there be more?" "Some more are coming." "When will they get here?" "I don't know. You ask a great many questions for a sick boy." "I'm not sick," I said, "I'm wounded." They had finished making the bed and I lay with a clean smooth sheet under me and another sheet over me. Mrs. Walker went out and came back with a pajama jacket. They put that on me and I felt very clean and dressed. "You're awfully nice to me," I said. The nurse called Miss Gage giggled. "Could I have a drink of water?" I asked. "Certainly. Then you can have breakfast." "I don't want breakfast. Can I have the shutters opened please?" The light had been dim in the room and when the shutters were opened it was bright sunlight and I looked out on a balcony and beyond were the tile roofs of houses and chimneys. I looked out over the tiled roofs and saw white clouds and the sky very blue. "Don't you know when the other nurses are com- ing?" "Why? Don't we take good care of you?" "You're very nice." "Would you like to use the bedpan?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 93 "I might try." They helped me and held me up but it was not any use. Afterward I lay and looked out the open doors onto the balcony. "When does the doctor come?" "When he gets back. We've tried to telephone to Lake Como for him." "Aren't there any other doctors?" "He's the doctor for the hospital." Miss Gage brought a pitcher of water and a glass. I drank three glasses and then they left me and I looked out the window a while and went back to sleep. I ate some lunch and in the afternoon Miss Van Campen, the superintendent, came up to see me. She did not like me and I did not like her. She was small and neatly suspicious and too good for her position. She asked many questions and seemed to think it was some- what disgraceful that I was with the Italians. "Can I have wine with the meals?" I asked her. "Only if the doctor prescribes it." "I can't have it until he comes?" "Absolutely not." "You plan on having him come eventually?" "We've telephoned him at Lake Como." She went out and Miss Gage came back. "Why were you rude to Miss Van Campen?" she asked after she had done something for me very skil- fully. "I didn't mean to be. But she was snooty." "She said you were domineering and rude." "I wasn't. But what's the idea of a hospital with- out a doctor?" "He's coming. They've telephoned for him to Lake Como." 94 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "What does he do there? Swim?" "No. He has a clinic there." "Why don't they get another doctor?" "Hush. Hush. Be a good boy and he'll come." I sent for the porter and when he came I told him in Italian to get me a bottle of Cinzano at the wine shop, a fiasco of chianti and the evening papers. He went away and brought them wrapped in newspaper, un- wrapped them and, when I asked him to, drew the corks and put the wine and vermouth under the bed. They left me alone and I lay in bed and read the papers awhile, the news from the front, and the list of dead officers with their decorations and then reached down and brought up the bottle of Cinzano and held it straight up on my stomach, the cool glass against my stomach, and took little drinks making rings on my stomach from holding the bottle there between drinks, and watched it get dark outside over the roofs of the town. The swallows circled around and I watched them and the night-hawks flying above the roofs and drank the Cinzano. Miss Gage brought up a glass with some egg-nog in it. I lowered the vermouth bottle to the other side of the bed when she came in. "Miss Van Campen had some sherry put in this," she said. "You shouldn't be rude to her. She's not young and this hospital is a big responsibility for her. Mrs. Walker's too old and she's no use to her." "She's a splendid woman," I said. "Thank her very much." "I'm going to bring your supper right away." "That's all right," I said. "I'm not hungry." When she brought the tray and put it on the bed table I thanked her and ate a little of the supper. After- ward it was dark outside and I could see the beams of A FAREWELL TO ARMS 95 the search-lights moving in the sky. I watched for a while and then went to sleep. I slept heavily except once I woke sweating and scared and then went back to sleep trying to stay outside of my dream. I woke for good long before it was light and heard roosters crowing and stayed on awake until it began to be light. I was tired and once it was really light I went back to sleep again. CHAPTER XIV It was bright sunlight in the room when I woke. I thought I was back at the front and stretched out in bed. My legs hurt me and I looked down at them still in the dirty bandages, and seeing them knew where I was. I reached up for the bell-cord and pushed the button. I heard it buzz down the hall and then some one coming on rubber soles along the hall. It was Miss Gage and she looked a little older in the bright sun- light and not so pretty. "Good morning," she said. "Did you have a good night ?" "Yes. Thanks very much," I said. "Can I have a barber?" "I came in to see you and you were asleep with this in the bed with you." She opened the armoire door and held up the ver- mouth bottle. It was nearly empty. "I put the other bottle from under the bed in there too," she said. "Why didn't you ask me for a glass?" "I thought maybe you wouldn't let me have it." "I'd have had some with you." "You're a fine girl." "It isn't good for you to drink alone," she said. "You mustn't do it." "All right." "Your friend Miss Barkley's come," she said. "Really?" "Yes. I don't like her." "You will like her. She's awfully nice." 96 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 97 She shook her head. "I'm sure she's fine. Can you move just a little to this side? That's fine. I'll clean you up for breakfast." She washed me with a cloth and soap and warm water. "Hold your shoulder up," she said. "That's fine." "Can I have the barber before breakfast?" "I'll send the porter for him." She went out and came back. "He's gone for him," she said and dipped the cloth she held in the basin of water. The barber came with the porter. He was a man of about fifty with an upturned mustache. Miss Gage was finished with me and went out and the barber lathered my face and shaved. He was very solemn and refrained from talking. "What's the matter ? Don't you know any news ?" I asked. "What news?" "Any news. What's happened in the town?" "It is time of war," he said. "The enemy's ears are everywhere." I looked up at him. "Please hold your face still," he said and went on shaving. "I will tell nothing." "What's the matter with you?" I asked. "I am an Italian. I will not communicate with the enemy." I let it go at that. If he was crazy, the sooner I could get out from under the razor the better. Once I tried to get a good look at him. "Beware," he said. "The razor is sharp." I paid him when it was over and tipped him half a lira. He returned the coins. "I will not I am not at the front. But I am an Italian." "Get the hell out of here." 98 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "With your permission," he said and wrapped his razors in newspaper. He went out leaving the five copper coins on the table beside the bed. I rang the bell. Miss Gage came in. "Would you ask the porter to come please?" "All right." The porter came in. He was trying to keep from laughing. "Is that barber crazy?" "No, signorino. He made a mistake. He doesn't understand very well and he thought I said you were an Austrian officer." "Oh," I said. "Ho ho ho," the porter laughed. "He was funny. One move from you he said and he would have â€” " he drew his forefinger across his throat. "Ho ho ho," he tried to keep from laughing. "When I tell him you were not an Austrian. Ho ho ho." "Ho ho ho," I said bitterly. "How funny if he would cut my throat. Ho ho ho." "No, signorino. No, no. He was so frightened of an Austrian. Ho ho ho." "Ho ho ho," I said. "Get out of here." He went out and I heard him laughing in the hall. I heard some one coming down the hallway. I looked toward the door. It was Catherine Barkley. She came in the room and over to the bed. "Hello, darling," she said. She looked fresh and young and very beautiful. I thought I had never seen any one so beautiful. "Hello," I said. When I saw her I was in love with her. Everything turned over inside of me. She looked toward the door, saw there was no one, then she A FAREWELL TO ARMS 99 sat on the side of the bed and leaned over and kissed me. I pulled her down and kissed her and felt her heart beating. "You sweet," I said. "Weren't you wonderful to come here?" "It wasn't very hard. It may be hard to stay." "You've got to stay," I said. "Oh, you're wonder- ful." I was crazy about her. I could not believe she was really there and held her tight to me. "You mustn't," she said. "You're not well enough." "Yes, I am. Come on." "No. You're not strong enough." "Yes. I am. Yes. Please." "You do love me?" "I really love you. I'm crazy about you. Come on please." "Feel our hearts beating." "I don't care about our hearts. I want you. I'm just mad about you." "You really love me?" "Don't keep on saying that. Come on. Please. Please, Catherine." "All right but only for a minute." "All right," I said. "Shut the door." "You can't. You shouldn't." "Come on. Don't talk. Please come on." Catherine sat in a chair by the bed. The door was open into the hall. The wildness was gone and I felt finer than I had ever felt. She asked, "Now do you believe I love you ?" "Oh, you're lovely," I said. "You've got to stay. They can't send you away. I'm crazy in love with you." ioo A FAREWELL TO ARMS "We'll have to be awfully careful. That was just madness. We can't do that." "We can at night." "We'll have to be awfully careful. You'll have to be careful in front of other people." "I will." "You'll have to be. You're sweet. You do love me, don't you?" "Don't say that again. You don't know what that does to me." "I'll be careful then. I don't want to do anything more to you. I have to go now, darling, really." "Come back right away." "I'll come when I can." "Good-by." "Good-by, sweet." She went out. God knows I had not wanted to fall in love with her. I had not wanted to fall in love with any one. But God knows I had and I lay on the bed in the room of the hospital in Milan and all sorts of things went through my head but I felt wonderful and finally Miss Gage came in. "The doctor's coming," she said. "He telephoned from Lake Como." "When does he get here?" "He'll be here this afternoon." CHAPTER XV Nothing happened until afternoon. The doctor was a thin quiet little man who seemed disturbed by the war. He took out a number of small steel splinters from my thighs with delicate and refined distaste. He used a local anaesthetic called something or other "snow," which froze the tissue and avoided pain until the probe, the scalpel or the forceps got below the frozen portion. The anaesthetized area was clearly defined by the pa- tient and after a time the doctor's fragile delicacy was exhausted and he said it would be better to have an X-ray. Probing was unsatisfactory, he said. The X-ray was taken at the Ospedale Maggiore and the doctor who did it was excitable, efficient and cheer- ful. It was arranged by holding up the shoulders, that the patient should see personally some of the larger foreign bodies through the machine. The plates were to be sent over. The doctor requested me to write in his pocket notebook, my name, and regiment and some sentiment. He declared that the foreign bodies were ugly, nasty, brutal. The Austrians were sons of bitches. How many had I killed? I had not killed any but I was anxious to please â€” and I said I had killed plenty. Miss Gage was with me and the doctor put his arm around her and said she was more beautiful than Cleo- patra. Did she understand that? Cleopatra the for- mer queen of Egypt. Yes, by God she was. We re- turned to the little hospital in the ambulance and after a while and much lifting I was upstairs and in bed again. The plates came that afternoon, the doctor had said by God he would have them that afternoon and he 102 A FAREWELL TO ARMS did. Catherine Barkley showed them to me. They were in red envelopes and she took them out of the en- velopes and held them up to the light and we both looked. "That's your right leg," she said, then put the plate back in the envelope. "This is your left." "Put them away," I said, "and come over to the bed." "I can't," she said. "I just brought them in for a second to show you." She went out and I lay there. It was a hot after- noon and I was sick of lying in bed. I sent the porter for the papers, all the papers he could get. Before he came back three doctors came into the room. I have noticed that doctors who fail in the practice of medicine have a tendency to seek one another's com- pany and aid in consultation. A doctor who cannot take out your appendix properly will recommend to you a doctor who will be unable to remove your tonsils with success. These were three such doctors. "This is the young man," said the house doctor with the delicate hands. "How do you do?" said the tall gaunt doctor with the beard. The third doctor, who carried the X-ray plates in their red envelopes, said nothing. "Remove the dressings?" questioned the bearded doctor. "Certainly. Remove the dressings, please, nurse," the house doctor said to Miss Gage. Miss Gage re- moved the dressings. I looked down at the legs. At the field hospital they had the look of not too freshly ground hamburger steak. Now they were crusted and the knee was swollen and discolored and the calf sunken but there was no pus. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 103 "Very clean/' said the house doctor. "Very clean and nice." "Urn," said the doctor with the beard. The third doctor looked over the house doctor's shoulder. "Please move the knee," said the bearded doctor. "I can't." "Test the articulation?" the bearded doctor ques- tioned. He had a stripe beside the three stars on his sleeve. That meant he was a first captain. "Certainly," the house doctor said. Two of them took hold of my right leg very gingerly and bent it. "That hurts," I said. "Yes. Yes. A little further, doctor." "That's enough. That's as far as it goes," I said. "Partial articulation," said the first captain. He straightened up. "May I see the plates again, please, doctor?" The third doctor handed him one of the plates. "No. The left leg, please." "That is the left leg, doctor." "You are right. I was looking from a different an- gle." He returned the plate. The other plate he exam- ined for some time. "You see, doctor?" he pointed to one of the foreign bodies which showed spherical and clear against the light. They examined the plate for some time. "Only one thing I can say," the first captain with the beard said. "It is a question of time. Three months, six months probably." "Certainly the synovial fluid must re-form." "Certainly. It is a question of time. I could not conscientiously open a knee like that before the projec- tile was encysted." "I agree with you, doctor." "Six months for what?" I asked. io 4 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Six months for the projectile to encyst before the knee can be opened safely." "I don't believe it," I said. "Do you want to keep your knee, young man?" "No," I said. "What?" "I want it cut off," I said, "so I can wear a hook on it." "What do you mean? A hook?" "He is joking," said the house doctor. He patted my shoulder very delicately. "He wants to keep his knee. This is a very brave young man. He has been proposed for the silver medal of valor." "All my felicitations," said the first captain. He shook my hand. "I can only say that to be on the safe side you should wait at least six months before open- ing such a knee. You are welcome of course to an- other opinion." "Thank you very much," I said. "I value your opinion." The first captain looked at his watch. "We must go," he said. "All my best wishes." "All my best wishes and many thanks," I said. I shook hands with the third doctor, "Capitano Varini â€” Tenente Enry," and they all three went out of the room. "Miss Gage," I called. She came in. "Please ask the house doctor to come back a minute." He came in holding his cap and stood by the bed. "Did you wish to see me?" "Yes. I can't wait six months to be operated on. My God, doctor, did you ever stay in bed six months?" "You won't be in bed all the time. You must first have the wounds exposed to the sun. Then afterward you can be on crutches." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 105 "For six months and then have an operation?''' "That is the safe way. The foreign bodies must be allowed to encyst and the synovial fluid will re-form. Then it will be safe to open up the knee." "Do you really think yourself I will have to wait that long?" "That is the safe way." "Who is that first captain?" "He is a very excellent surgeon of Milan." "He's a first captain, isn't he?" "Yes, but he is an excellent surgeon." "I don't want my leg fooled with by a first captain. If he was any good he would be made a major. I know what a first captain is, doctor." "He is an excellent surgeon and I would rather have his judgment than any surgeon I know." "Could another surgeon see it?" "Certainly if you wish. But I would take Dr. Va- rella's opinion myself." "Could you ask another surgeon to come and see it?" "I will ask Valentini to come." "Who is he?" "He is a surgeon of the Ospedale Maggiore." "Good. I appreciate it very much. You understand, doctor, I couldn't stay in bed six months." "You would not be in bed. You would first take a sun cure. Then you could have light exercise. Then when it was encysted we would operate." "But I can't wait six months." The doctor spread his delicate fingers on the cap he held and smiled. "You are in such a hurry to get back to the front?" "Why not?" 106 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "It is very beautiful," he said. "You are a noble young man." He stooped over and kissed me very del- icately on the forehead. "I will send for Valentini. Do not worry and excite yourself. Be a good boy." "Will you have a drink?" I asked. "No thank you. I never drink alcohol." "Just have one." I rang for the porter to bring glasses. "No. No thank you. They are waiting for me." "Good-by," I said. "Good-by." Two hours later Dr. Valentini came into the room. He was in a great hurry and the points of his mustache stood straight up. He was a major, his face was tanned and he laughed all the time. "How did you do it, this rotten thing?" he asked. "Let me see the plates. Yes. Yes. That's it. You look healthy as a goat. Who's the pretty girl? Is she your girl? I thought so. Isn't this a bloody war? How does that feel ? You are a fine boy. I'll make you bet- ter than new. Does that hurt? You bet it hurts. How they love to hurt you, these doctors. What have they done for you so far ? Can't that girl talk Italian ? She should learn. What a lovely girl. I could teach her. I will be a patient here myself. No, but I will do all your maternity work free. Does she understand that ? She will make you a fine boy. A fine blonde like she is. That's fine. That's all right. What a lovely girl. Ask her if she eats supper with me. No I won't take her away from you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Miss. That's all." "That's all I want to know." He patted me on the shoulder. "Leave the dressings off." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 107 " Will you have a drink, Dr. Valentini ?" "A drink? Certainly. I will have ten drinks. Where are they?" "In the armoire. Miss Barkley will get the bottle." "Cheery oh. Cheery oh to you, Miss. What a lovely girl. I will bring you better cognac than that." He wiped his mustache. "When do you think it can be operated on?" "To-morrow morning. Not before. Your stomach must be emptied. You must be washed out. I will see the old lady downstairs and leave instructions. Good- by. I see you to-morrow. I'll bring you better cognac than that. You are very comfortable here. Good-by. Until to-morrow. Get a good sleep. I'll see you early." He waved from the doorway, his mustaches went straight up, his brown face was smiling. There was a star in a box on his sleeve because he was a major. CHAPTER XVI That night a bat flew into the room through the open door that led onto the balcony and through which we watched the night over the roofs of the town. It was dark in our room except for the small light of the night over the town and the bat was not frightened but hunted in the room as though he had been outside. We lay and watched him and I do not think he saw us be- cause we lay so still. After he went out we saw a searchlight come on and watched the beam move across the sky and then go off and it was dark again. A breeze came in the night and we heard the men of the anti-aircraft gun on the next roof talking. It was cool and they were putting on their capes. I worried in the night about some one coming up but Catherine said they were all asleep. Once in the night we went to sleep and when I woke she was not there but I heard her coming along the hall and the door opened and she came back to the bed and said it was all right she had been downstairs and they were all asleep. She had been outside Miss Van Campen's door and heard her breathing in her sleep. She brought crackers and we ate them and drank some vermouth. We were very hungry but she said that would all have to be gotten out of me in the morning. I went to sleep again in the morning when it was light and when I was awake I found she was gone again. She came in looking fresh and lovely and sat on the bed and the sun rose while I had the thermometer in my mouth and we smelled the dew on the roofs and then the coffee of the men at the gun on the next roof. 108 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 109 "I wish we could go for a walk," Catherine said. "I'd wheel you if we had a chair." "How would I get into the chair?" "We'd do it." "We could go out to the park and have breakfast outdoors." I looked out the open doorway. "What we'll really do," she said, "is get you ready for your friend Dr. Valentini." "I thought he was grand." "I didn't like him as much as you did. But I imag- ine he's very good." "Come back to bed, Catherine. Please," I said. "I can't. Didn't we have a lovely night?" "And can you be on night duty to-night?" "I probably will. But you won't want me." "Yes, I will." "No, you won't. You've never been operated on. You don't know how you'll be." "I'll be all right." "You'll be sick and I won't be anything to you." "Come back then now." "No," she said. "I have to do the chart, darling, and fix you up." "You don't really love me or you'd come back again." "You're such a silly boy." She kissed me. "That's all right for the chart. Your temperature's always nor- mal. You've such a lovely temperature." "You've got a lovely everything." "Oh no. You have the lovely temperature. I'm aw- fully proud of your temperature." "Maybeall our children will have fine temperatures." "Our children will probably have beastly tempera- tures." no A FAREWELL TO ARMS "What do you have to do to get me ready for Valen- tin! ?" "Not much. But quite unpleasant." "I wish you didn't have to do it." "I don't. I don't want any one else to touch you. I'm silly. I get furious if they touch you." "Even Ferguson?" "Especially Ferguson and Gage and the other, what's her name?" "Walker?" "That's it. They've too many nurses here now. There must be some more patients or they'll send us away. They have four nurses now." "Perhaps there'll be some. They need that many nurses. It's quite a big hospital." "I hope some will come. What would I do if they sent me away? They will unless there are more pa- tients." "I'd go too." "Don't be silly. You can't go yet. But get well quickly, darling, and we will go somewhere." "And then what?" "Maybe the war will be over. It can't always go on." "I'll get well," I said. "Valentini will fix me." "He should with those mustaches. And, darling, when you're going under the ether just think about something else â€” not us. Because people get very blabby under an anaesthetic." "What should I think about?" "Anything. Anything but us. Think about your people. Or even any other girl." "No." A FAREWELL TO ARMS in "Say your prayers then. That ought to create a splendid impression." "Maybe I won't talk." "That's true. Often people don't talk." "I won't talk." "Don't brag, darling. Please don't brag. You're so sweet and you don't have to brag." "I won't talk a word." "Now you're bragging, darling. You know you don't need to brag. Just start your prayers or poetry or something when they tell you to breathe deeply. You'll be lovely that way and I'll be so proud of you. I'm very proud of you anyway. You have such a lovely temperature and you sleep like a little boy with your arm around the pillow and think it's me. Or is it some other girl? Some fine Italian girl?" "It's you." "Of course it's me. Oh I do love you and Valen- tini will make you a fine leg. I'm glad I don't have to watch it." "And you'll be on night duty to-night." "Yes. But you won't care." "You wait and see." "There, darling. Now you're all clean inside and out. Tell me. How many people have you ever loved?" "Nobody." "Not me even?" "Yes, you." "How many others really?" "None." "How many have you â€” how do you say it? â€” stayed with?" "None." ii2 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "You're lying to me." "Yes." "It's all right. Keep right on lying to me. That's what I want you to do. Were they pretty ?" "I never stayed with any one." "That's right. Were they very attractive?" "I don't know anything about it." "You're just mine. That's true and you've never be- longed to any one else. But I don't care if you have. I'm not afraid of them. But don't tell me about them. When a man stays with a girl when does she say how much it costs ?" "I don't know." "Of course not Does she say she loves him? Tell me that I want to know that." "Yes. If he wants her to." "Does he say he loves her ? Tell me please. It's im- portant." "He does if he wants to." "But you never did ? Really ?" "No." "Not really. Tell me the truth?" "No," I lied. "You wouldn't," she said. "I knew you wouldn't. Oh, I love you, darling." Outside the sun was up over the roofs and I could see the points of the cathedral with the sunlight on them. I was clean inside and outside and waiting for the doctor. "And that's it?" Catherine said. "She says just what he wants her to?" "Not always." "But I will. I'll say just what you wish and I'll do what you wish and then you will never want any other A FAREWELL TO ARMS 113 girls, will you?" She looked at me very happily. "I'll do what you want and say what you want and then I'll be a great success, won't I?" "Yes." "What would you like me to do now that you're all ready?" "Come to the bed again." "All right. I'll come." "Oh, darling, darling, darling," I said. "You see," she said. "I do anything you want." "You're so lovely." "I'm afraid I'm not very good at it yet." "You're lovely." "I want what you want. There isn't any me any more. Just what you want." "You sweet." "I'm good. Aren't I good? You don't want any other girls, do you?" "No." "You see? I'm good. I do what you want." CHAPTER XVII When I was awake after the operation I had not been away. You do not go away. They only choke you. It is not like dying it is just a chemical choking so you do not feel, and afterward you might as well have been drunk except that when you throw up noth- ing comes but bile and you do not feel better after- ward. I saw sandbags at the end of the bed. They were on pipes that came out of the cast. After a while I saw Miss Gage and she said, "How is it now?" "Better," I said. "He did a wonderful job on your knee." "How long did it take ?" "Two hours and a half." "Did I say anything silly?" "Not a thing. Don't talk. Just be quiet." I was sick and Catherine was right. It did not make any difference who was on night duty. There were three other patients in the hospital now, a thin boy in the Red Cross from Georgia with mala- ria, a nice boy, also thin, from New York, with mala- ria and jaundice, and a fine boy who had tried to un- screw the fuse-cap from a combination shrapnel and high explosive shell for a souvenir. This was a shrap- nel shell used by the Austrians in the mountains with a nose-cap which went on after the burst and exploded on contact. Catherine Barkley was greatly liked by the nurses because she would do night duty indefinitely. She had quite a little work with the malaria people, the boy who 114 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 115 had unscrewed the nose-cap was a friend of ours and never rang at night, unless it was necessary but be- tween the times of working we were together. I loved her very much and she loved me. I slept in the day- time and we wrote notes during the day when we were awake and sent them by Ferguson. Ferguson was a fine girl. I never learned anything about her except that she had a brother in the Fifty-Second Division and a brother in Mesopotamia and she was very good to Catherine Barkley. "Will you come to our wedding, Fergy?" I said to her once. "You'll never get married." "We will." "No you won't." "Why not?" "You'll fight before you'll marry." "We never fight." "You've time yet." "We don't fight." "You'll die then. Fight or die. That's what people do. They don't marry." I reached for her hand. "Don't take hold of me," she said. "I'm not crying. Maybe you'll be all right you two. But watch out you don't get her in trouble. You get her in trouble and I'll kill you." "I won't get her in trouble." "Well watch out then. I hoge you'll be all right. You have a good time." "We have a fine time." "Don't fight then and don't get her into trouble." 1 won t. "Mind you watch out. I don't want her with any of these war babies." n6 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "You're a fine girl, Fergy." "I'm not. Don't try to flatter me. How does your leg feel?" "Fine." "How is your head?" She touched the top of it with her fingers. It was sensitive like a foot that had gone to sleep. "It's never bothered me." "A bump like that could make you crazy. It never bothers you?" "No." "You're a lucky young man. Have you the letter done? I'm going down." "It's here," I said. "You ought to ask her not to do night duty for a while. She's getting very tired." "All right. I will." "I want to do it but she won't let me. The others are glad to let her have it. You might give her just a little rest." "All right." "Miss Van Campen spoke about you sleeping all the forenoons." "She would." "It would be better if you let her stay off nights a little while." "I want her to." "You do not. But if you would make her I'd re- spect you for it." "I'll make her." "I don't believe it." She took the note and went out. I rang the bell and in a little while Miss Gage came in. "What's the matter?" "I just wanted to talk to you. Don't you think Miss Barkley ought to go off night duty for a while? She A FAREWELL TO ARMS 117 looks awfully tired. Why does she stay on so long?" Miss Gage looked at me. "I'm a friend of yours," she said. "You don't have to talk to me like that." "What do you mean?" "Don't be silly. Was that all you wanted?" "Do you want a vermouth?" "All right. Then I have to go." She got out the bottle from the armoire and brought a glass. "You take the glass," I said. 'Til drink out of the bottle." "Here's to you," said Miss Gage. "What did Van Campen say about me sleeping late in the mornings?" "She just jawed about it. She calls you our priv- ileged patient." "To hell with her." "She isn't mean," Miss Gage said. "She's just old and cranky. She never liked you." "No." "Well, I do. And I'm your friend. Don't forget that." "You're awfully damned nice." "No. I know who you think is nice. But I'm your friend. How does your leg feel?" "Fine." "I'll bring some cold mineral water to pour over it. It must itch under the cast. It's hot outside." "You're awful nice." "Does it itch much?" "No. It's fine." "I'll fix those sandbags better." She leaned over. "I'm your friend." "I know you are." n8 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "No you don't. But you will some day." Catherine Barkley took three nights off night duty and then she came back on again. It was as though we met again after each of us had been away on a long journey. CHAPTER XVIII We had a lovely time that summer. When I could go out we rode in a carriage in the park. I remember the carriage, the horse going slowly, and up ahead the back of the driver with his varnished high hat, and Catherine Barkley sitting beside me. If we let our hands touch, just the side of my hand touching hers, we were excited. Afterward when I could get around on crutches we went to dinner at Biffi's or the Gran Italia and sat at the tables outside on the floor of the galleria. The waiters came in and out and there were people going by and candles with shades on the table- cloths and after we decided that we liked the Gran Italia best, George, the head-waiter, saved us a table. He was a fine waiter and we let him order the meal while we looked at the people, and the great galleria in the dusk, and each other. We drank dry white capri iced in a bucket ; although we tried many of the other wines, f resa, barbera and the sweet white wines. They had no wine waiter because of the war and George would smile ashamedly when I asked about wines like fresa. "If you imagine a country that makes a wine be- cause it tastes like strawberries," he said. "Why shouldn't it?" Catherine asked. "It sounds splendid/ ' "You try it, lady," said George, "if you want to. But let me bring a little bottle of margaux for the Tenente." "I'll try it too, George." 119 120 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Sir, I can't recommend you to. It doesn't even taste like strawberries/' "It might," said Catherine. "It would be wonderful if it did." "I'll bring it," said George, "and when the Lady is satisfied I'll take it away." It was not much of a wine. As he said, it did not even taste like strawberries. We went back to capri. One evening I was short of money and George loaned me a hundred lire. "That's all right, Tenente," he said. "I know how it is. I know how a man gets short. If you or the lady need money I've always got money." After dinner we walked through the galleria, past the other restaurants and the shops with their steel shutters down, and stopped at the little place where they sold sandwiches ; ham and lettuce sandwiches and anchovy sandwiches made of very tiny brown glazed rolls and only about as long as your finger. They were to eat in the night when we were hungry. Then we got into an open carriage outside the galleria in front of the cathedral and rode to the hospital. At the door of the hospital the porter came out to help w r ith the crutches. I paid the driver, and then we rode upstairs in the elevator. Catherine got off at the lower floor where the nurses lived and I went on up and went down the hall on crutches to my room ; sometimes I un- dressed and got into bed and sometimes I sat out on the balcony with my leg up on another chair and watched the swallows over the roofs and waited for Catherine. When she came upstairs it was as though she had been away on a long trip and I went along the hall with her on the crutches and carried the basins and waited out- side the doors, or went in with her; it depending on whether they were friends of ours or not, and when A FAREWELL TO ARMS 121 she had done all there was to be done we sat out on the balcony outside my room. Afterward I went to bed and when they were all asleep and she was sure they would not call she came in. I loved to take her hair down and she sat on the bed and kept very still, except suddenly she would dip down to kiss me while I was doing it, and I would take out the pins and lay them on the sheet and it would be loose and I would watch her while she kept very still and then take out the last two pins and it would all come down and she would drop her head and we would both be inside of it, and it was the feeling of inside a tent or behind a falls. She had wonderfully beautiful hair and I would lie sometimes and watch her twisting it up in the light that came in the open door and it shone even in the night as water shines sometimes just before it is really daylight. She had a lovely face and body and lovely smooth skin too. We would be lying together and I would touch her cheeks and her forehead and under her eyes and her chin and throat with the tips of my fingers and say, "Smooth as piano keys," and she would stroke my chin with her finger and say, "Smooth as emery paper and very hard on piano keys." "Is it rough?" "No, darling. I was just making fun of you." It was lovely in the nights and if we could only touch each other we were happy. Besides all the big times we had many small ways of making love and we tried putting thoughts in the other one's head while we were in different rooms. It seemed to work sometimes but that was probably because we were thinking the same thing anyway. We said to each other that we were married the first day she had come to the hospital and we counted 122 A FAREWELL TO ARMS months from our wedding day. I wanted to be really married but Catherine said that if we were they would send her away and if we merely started on the for- malities they would watch her and would break us up. We would have to be married under Italian law and the formalities were terrific. I wanted us to be married really because I worried about having a child if I thought about it, but we pretended to ourselves we were married and did not worry much and I suppose I en- joyed not being married, really. I know one night we talked about it and Catherine said, "But, darling, they'd send me away." "Maybe they wouldn't." "They would. They'd send me home and then we would be apart until after the war." "I'd come on leave." "You couldn't get to Scotland and back on a leave. Besides, I won't leave you. What good would it do to marry now? We're really married. I couldn't be any more married." "I only wanted to for you." "There isn't any me. I'm you. Don't make up a separate me." "I thought girls always wanted to be married." "They do. But, darling, I am married. I'm married to you. Don't I make you a good wife?" "You're a lovely wife." "You see, darling, I had one experience of waiting to be married." "I don't want to hear about it." "You know I don't love any one but you. You shouldn't mind because some one else loved me." "I do." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 123 "You shouldn't be jealous of some one who's dead when you have every thing.' ' | "No, but I don't want to hear about it." "Poor darling. And I know you've been with all kinds of girls and it doesn't matter to me." "Couldn't we be married privately some way? Then if anything happened to me or if you had a child." "There's no way to be married except by church or state. We are married privately. You see, darling, it would mean everything to me if I had any religion. But I haven't any religion." "You gave me the Saint Anthony." "That was for luck. Some one gave it to me." "Then nothing worries you?" "Only being sent away from you. You're my re- ligion. You're all I've got." "All right. But I'll marry you the day you say." "Don't talk as though you had to make an honest woman of me, darling. I'm a very honest woman. You can't be ashamed of something if you're only happy and proud of it. Aren't you happy?" "But you won't ever leave me for some one else." "No, darling. I won't ever leave you for some one else. I suppose all sorts of dreadful things will happen to us. But you don't have to worry about that." "I don't. But I love you so much and you did love some one else before." "And what happened to him?" "He died." "Yes and if he hadn't I wouldn't have met you. I'm not unfaithful, darling. I've plenty of faults but I'm very faithful. You'll be sick of me I'll be so faithful." "I'll have to go back to the front pretty soon." "We won't think about that until you go. You see 12 4 A FAREWELL TO ARMS I'm happy, darling, and we have a lovely time. I haven't been happy for a long time and when I met you perhaps I was nearly crazy. Perhaps I was crazy. But now we're happy and we love each other. Do let's please just be happy. You are happy, aren't you? Is there anything I do you don't like ? Can I do anything to please you? Would you like me to take down my hair? Do you want to play?" "Yes and come to bed." "All right. I'll go and see the patients first" CHAPTER XIX The summer went that way. I do not remember much about the days, except that they were hot and that there were many victories in the papers. I was very healthy and my legs healed quickly so that it was not very long after I was first on crutches be- fore I was through with them and walking with a cane. Then I started treatments at the Ospedale Maggiore for bending the knees, mechanical treatments, baking in a box of mirrors with violet rays, massage, and baths. I went over there afternoons and afterward stopped at the cafe and had a drink and read the papers. I did not roam around the town; but wanted to get home to the hospital from the cafe. All I wanted was to see Catherine. The rest of the time I was glad to kill. Mostly I slept in the mornings, and in the afternoons, sometimes, I went to the races, and late to the mech- anotherapy treatments. Sometimes I stopped in at the Anglo-American Club and sat in a deep leather- cushioned chair in front of the window and read the magazines. They would not let us go out together when I was off crutches because it was unseemly for a nurse to be seen unchaperoned with a patient who did not look as though he needed attendance, so we were not together much in the afternoons. Although some- times we could go out to dinner if Ferguson went along. Miss Van Campen had accepted the status that we were great friends because she got a great amount of work out of Catherine. She thought Catherine came from very good people and that prejudiced her in her favor finally. Miss Van Campen admired fam- 125 126 A FAREWELL TO ARMS ily very much and came from an excellent family her- self. The hospital was quite busy, too, and that kept her occupied. It was a hot summer and I knew many people in Milan but always was anxious to get back home to the hospital as soon as the afternoon was over. At the front they were advancing on the Carso, they had taken Kuk across from Plava and were taking the Bainsizza plateau. The West front did not sound so good. It looked as though the war were going on for a long time. We were in the war now but I thought it would take a year to get any great amount of troops over and train them for combat. Next year would be a bad year, or a good year maybe. The Italians were using up an awful amount of men. I did not see how it could go on. Even if they took all the Bainsizza and Monte San Gabriele there were plenty of mountains beyond for the Austrians. I had seen them. All the highest mountains were beyond. On the Carso they were going forward but there were marshes and swamps down by the sea. Napoleon would have whipped the Austrians on the plains. He never would have fought them in the mountains. He would have let them come down and whipped them around Verona. Still nobody was whipping any one on the Western front. Perhaps wars weren't won any more. Maybe they went on forever. Maybe it was another Hundred Years' War. I put the paper back on the rack and left the club. I went down the steps carefully and walked up the Via Manzoni. Outside the Gran Hotel I met old Meyers and his wife getting out of a carriage. They were coming back from the races. She was a big- busted woman in black satin. He was short and old, with a white mustache and walked flat-footed with a cane. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 127 "How do you do? How do you do?" She shook hands. "Hello/' said Meyers. "How were the races ?" "Fine. They were just lovely. I had three winners." "How did you do?" I asked Meyers. "All right. I had a winner." "I never know how he does," Mrs. Meyers said. "He never tells me." "I do all right," Meyers said. He was being cordial. "You ought to come out." While he talked you had the impression that he was not looking at you or that he mistook you for some one else. "I will," I said. "I'm coming up to the hospital to see you," Mrs. Meyers said. "I have some things for my boys. You're all my boys. You certainly are my dear boys." "They'll be glad to see you." "Those dear boys. You too. You're one of my boys." "I have to get back," I said. "You give my love to all those dear boys. I've got lots of things to bring. Fve some fine Marsala and cakes." "Good-by," I said. "They'll be awfully glad to see you." "Good-by," said Meyers. "You come around to the galleria. You know where my table is. We're all there every afternoon." I went on up the street. I wanted to buy something at the Cova to take to Catherine. In- side, at the Cova, I bought a box of chocolate and while, the girl wrapped it up I walked over to the bar. There were a couple of British and some aviators. I had a martini alone, paid for it, picked up the box of choco- late at the outside counter and walked on home toward 128 A FAREWELL TO ARMS the hospital. Outside the little bar up the street from the Scala there were some people I knew, a vice-con- sul, two fellows who studied singing, and Ettore Moretti, an Italian from San Francisco who was in the Italian army. I had a drink with them. One of the singers was named Ralph Simmons, and he was singing under the name of Enrico DelCredo. I never knew how well he could sing but he was always on the point of some- thing very big happening. He was fat and looked shopworn around the nose and mouth as though he had hay fever. He had come back from singing in Piacenza. He had sung Tosca and it had been won- derful. "Of course youVe never heard me sing," he said. "When will you sing here?" 'Til be at the Scala in the fall." 'Til bet they throw the benches at you," Ettore said. "Did you hear how they threw the benches at him in Modena?" "It's a damned lie." "They threw the benches at him," Ettore said. "I was there. I threw six benches myself." "You're just a wop from Frisco." "He can't pronounce Italian," Ettore said. "Every- where he goes they throw the benches at him." "Piacenza's the toughest house to sing in the north of Italy," the other tenor said. "Believe me that's a tough little house to sing." This tenor's name was Ed- gar Saunders, and he sang under the name of Edouardo Giovanni. "I'd like to be there to see them throw the benches at you," Ettore said. "You can't sing Italian." "He's a nut," said Edgar Saunders. "All he knows how to say is throw benches." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 129 "That's all they know how to do when you two sing," Ettore said. "Then when you go to America you'll tell about your triumphs at the Scala. They wouldn't let you get by the first note at the Scala." "I'll sing at the Scala," Simmons said. "I'm going to sing Tosca in October." "We'll go, won't we, Mac?" Ettore said to the vice- consul. "They'll need somebody to protect them." "Maybe the American army will be there to protect them," the vice-consul said. "Do you want another drink, Simmons? You want a drink, Saunders?" "All right," said Saunders. "I hear you're going to get the silver medal," Ettore said to me. "What kind of citation you going to get?" "I don't know. I don't know I'm going to get it" "You're going to get it. Oh boy, the girls at the Cova will think you're fine then. They'll all think you killed two hundred Austrians or captured a whole trench by yourself. Believe me, I got to work for my decorations." "How many have you got, Ettore?" asked the vice- consul. "He's got everything," Simmons said. "He's the boy they're running the war for." "I've got the bronze twice and three silver medals," said Ettore. "But the papers on only one have come through." "What's the matter with the others?" asked Sim- mons. "The action wasn't successful," said Ettore. "When the action isn't successful they hold up all the medals." "How many times have you been wounded, Ettore ?" "Three times bad. I got three wound stripes. See?" 130 A FAREWELL TO ARMS He pulled his sleeve around. The stripes were parallel silver lines on a black background sewed to the cloth of the sleeve about eight inches below the shoulder. "You got one too," Ettore said to me. "Believe me they're fine to have. I'd rather have them than medals. Believe me, boy, when you get three you've got some- thing. You only get one for a wound that puts you three months in the hospital." "Where were you wounded, Ettore?" asked the vice- consul. Ettore pulled up his sleeve. "Here," he showed the deep smooth red scar. "Here on my leg. I can't show you that because I got puttees on; and in the foot. There's dead bone in my foot that stinks right now. Every morning I take new little pieces out and it stinks all the time." "What hit you?" asked Simmons. "A hand-grenade. One of those potato mashers. It just blew the whole side of my foot off. You know those potato mashers?" He turned to me. "Sure." "I saw the son of a bitch throw it," Ettore said. "It knocked me down and I thought I was dead all right but those damn potato mashers haven't got anything in them. I shot the son of a bitch with my rifle. I al- ways carry a rifle so they can't tell I'm an officer." "How did he look?" asked Simmons. "That was the only one he had," Ettore said. "I don't know why he threw it. I guess he always wanted to throw one. He never saw any real fighting probably. I shot the son of a bitch all right." "How did he look when you shot him?" Simmons asked. "Hell, how should I know," said Ettore. "I shot him A FAREWELL TO ARMS 131 in the belly. I was afraid I'd miss him if I shot him in the head." "How long have you been an officer, Ettore?" I asked. 'Two years. I'm going to be a captain. How long have you been a lieutenant?" "Going on three years." "You can't be a captain because you don't know the Italian language well enough," Ettore said. "You can talk but you can't read and write well enough. You got to have an education to be a captain. Why don't you go in the American army?" "Maybe I will." "I wish to God I could. Oh, boy, how much does a captain get, Mac?" "I don't know exactly. Around two hundred and fifty dollars, I think." "Jesus Christ what I could do with two hundred and fifty dollars. You better get in the American army quick, Fred. See if you can't get me in." "All right." "I can command a company in Italian I could learn it in English easy." "You'd be a general," said Simmons. "No, I don't know enough to be a general. A gen- eral's got to know a hell of a lot. You guys think there ain't anything to war. You ain't got brains enough to be a second-class corporal." "Thank God I don't have to be," Simmons said. "Maybe you will if they round up all you slackers. Oh, boy, I'd like to have you two in my platoon. Mac too. I'd make you my orderly, Mac." "You're a great boy, Ettore," Mac said. "But I'm afraid you're a militarist." 132 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 'Til be a colonel before the war's over/' Ettore said. "If they don't kill you." "They won't kill me." He touched the stars at his collar with his thumb and forefinger. "See me do that? We always touch our stars if anybody mentions get- ting killed." "Let's go, Sim," said Saunders standing up. "All right." "So long," I said. "I have to go too." It was a quarter to six by the clock inside the bar. "Ciaou, Et- tore." "Ciaou, Fred," said Ettore. "That's pretty fine you're going to get the silver medal." "I don't know I'll get it." "You'll get' it all right, Fred. I heard you were go- ing to get it all right." "Well, so long," I said. "Keep out of trouble, Et- tore." "Don't worry about me. I don't drink and I don't run around. I'm no boozer and whorehound. I know what's good for me." "So long," I said. "I'm glad you're going to be pro- moted captain." "I don't have to wait to be promoted. I'm going to be a captain for merit of war. You know. Three stars with the crossed swords and crown above. That's me." "Good luck." "Good luck. When you going back to the front?" "Pretty soon." "Well, I'll see you around." "So long." "So long. Don't take any bad nickels." I walked on down a back street that led to a cross- cut to the hospital. Ettore was twenty-three. He had A FAREWELL TO ARMS 133 been brought up by an uncle in San Francisco and was visiting his father and mother in Torino when war was declared. He had a sister, who had been sent to Amer- ica with him at the same time to live with the uncle, who would graduate from normal school this year. He was a legitimate hero who bored every one he met. Catherine could not stand him. "We have heroes too," she said. "But usually, dar- ling, they're much quieter." "I don't mind him." "I wouldn't mind him if he wasn't so conceited and didn't bore me, and bore me, and bore me." "He bores me." "You're sweet to say so, darling. But you don't need to. You can picture him at the front and you know he's useful but he's so much the type of boy I don't care for." "I know." "You're awfully sweet to know, and I try and like him but he's a dreadful, dreadful boy really." "He said this afternoon he was going to be a cap- tain." "I'm glad," said Catherine. "That should please him." "Wouldn't you like me to have some more exalted rank?" "No, darling. I only want you to have enough rank so that we're admitted to the better restaurants." "That's just the rank I have." "You have a splendid rank. I don't want you to have any more rank. It might go to your head. Oh, darling, I'm awfully glad you're not conceited. I'd have married you even if you were conceited but it's very restful to have a husband who's not conceited." 134 A FAREWELL TO ARMS We were talking softly out on the balcony. The moon was supposed to rise but there was a mist over the town and it did not come up and in a little while it started to drizzle and we came in. Outside the mist turned to rain and in a little while it was raining hard and we heard it drumming on the roof. I got up and stood at the door to see if it was raining in but it wasn't, so I left the door open. "Who else did you see?" Catherine asked. "Mr. and Mrs. Meyers." "They're a strange lot." "He's supposed to have been in the penitentiary at home. They let him out to die." "And he lived happily in Milan forever after." "I don't know how happily." "Happily enough after jail I should think." "She's bringing some things here." "She brings splendid things. Were you her dear boy?" "One of them." "You are all her dear boys," Catherine said. "She prefers the dear boys. Listen to it rain." "It's raining hard." "And you'll always love me, won't you?" "Yes." "And the rain won't make any difference?" "No." "That's good. Because I'm afraid of the rain." "Why?" I was sleepy. Outside the rain was falling steadily. "I don't know, darling. I've always been afraid of the rain." "I like it." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 135 "I like to walk in it. But it's very hard on loving." "I'll love you always." "I'll love you in the rain and in the snow and in the hail and â€” what else is there?" "I don't know. I guess I'm sleepy." "Go to sleep, darling, and I'll love you no matter how it is." "You're not really afraid of the rain are you?" "Not when I'm with you." "Why are you afraid of it?" "I don't know." "Tell me." "Don't make me." "Tell me." "No." "Tell me." "All right. I'm afraid of the rain because some- times I see me dead in it." "No." "And sometimes I see you dead in it." "That's more likely." "No it's not, darling. Because I can keep you safe. I know I can. But nobody can help themselves." "Please stop it. I don't want you to get Scotch and crazy to-night. We won't be together much longer." "No, but I am Scotch and crazy. But I'll stop it. It's all nonsense." "Yes it's all nonsense." "It's all nonsense. It's only nonsense. Fm not afraid of the rain. I'm not afraid of the rain. Oh, oh, God, I wish I wasn't." She was crying. I comforted her and she stopped crying. But outside it kept on raining. CHAPTER XX One day in the afternoon we went to the races. Fer- guson went too and Crowell Rodgers, the boy who had been wounded in the eyes by the explosion of the shell nose-cap. The girls dressed to go after lunch while Crowell and I sat on the bed in his room and read the past performances of the horses and the predictions in the racing paper. Crowell's head was bandaged and he did not care much about these races but read the rac- ing paper constantly and kept track of all the horses for something to do. He said the horses were a terrible lot but they were all the horses we had. Old Meyers liked him and gave him tips. Meyers won on nearly every race but disliked to give tips because it brought down the prices. The racing was very crooked. Men who had been ruled off the turf everywhere else were racing in Italy. Meyers' information was good but I hated to ask him because sometimes he did not answer, and always you could see it hurt him to tell you, but he felt obligated to tell us for some reason and he hated less to tell Crowell. Crowell's eyes had been hurt, one was hurt badly, and Meyers had trouble with his eyes and so he liked Crowell. Meyers never told his wife what horses he was playing and she won or lost, mostly lost, and talked all the time. We four drove out to San Siro in an open carriage. It was a lovely day and we drove out through the park and out along the tramway and out of town where the road was dusty. There were villas with iron fences and big overgrown gardens and ditches with water flowing and green vegetable gardens with dust on the leaves. 136 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 137 We could look across the plain and see farmhouses and the rich green farms with their irrigation ditches and the mountains to the north. There were many car- riages going into the race track and the men at the gate let us in without cards because we were in uni- form. We left the carriage, bought programmes, and walked across the infield and then across the smooth thick turf of the course to the paddock. The grand stands were old and made of wood and the betting booths were under the stands and in a row out near the stables. There was a crowd of soldiers along the fence in the infield. The paddock was fairly well filled with people and they were walking the horses around in a ring under the trees behind the grand stand. We saw people we knew and got chairs for Ferguson and Catherine and watched the horses. They went around, one after the other, their heads down, the grooms leading them. One horse, a purplish black, Crowell swore was dyed that color. We watched him and it seemed possible. He had only come out just before the bell rang to saddle. We looked him up in the programme from the number on the groom's arm and it was listed a black gelding named Japalac. The race was for horses that had never won a race worth one thousand lire or more. Catherine was sure his color had been changed. Ferguson said she could not tell. I thought he looked suspicious. We all agreed we ought to back him and pooled one hun- dred lire. The odds sheets showed he would pay thirty- five to one. Crowell went over and bought the tickets while we watched the jockeys ride around once more and then go out under the trees to the track and gallop slowly up to the turn where the start was to be. We went up in the grand-stand to watch the race. 138 A FAREWELL TO ARMS They had no elastic barrier at San Siro then and tKi starter lined up all the horses, they looked very small way up the track, and then sent them off with a crack of his long whip. They came past us with the black horse well in front and on the turn he was running away from the others. I watched them on the far side with the glasses and saw the jockey fighting to hold him in but he could not hold him and when they came around the turn and into the stretch the black horse was fifteen lengths ahead of the others. He went way on up and around the turn after the finish. "Isn't it wonderful," Catherine said. "We'll have over three thousand lire. He must be a splendid horse." "I hope his color doesn't run," Crowell said, "before they pay off." "He was really a lovely horse," Catherine said. "I wonder if Mr. Meyers backed him." "Did you have the winner ?" I called to Meyers. He nodded. "I didn't," Mrs. Meyers said. "Who did you children bet on?" "Japalac." "Really? He's thirty-five to one!" "We liked his color." "I didn't. I thought he looked seedy. They told me not to back him." "He won't pay much," Meyers said. "He's marked thirty-five to one in the quotes," I said. "He won't pay much. At the last minute," Meyers said, "they put a lot of money on him." "Who?" "Kempton and the boys. You'll see. He won't pay two to one." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 139 "Then we won't get three thousand lire," Catherine said. "I don't like this crooked racing!" "We'll get two hundred lire." "That's nothing. That doesn't do us any good. I thought we were going to get three thousand." "It's crooked and disgusting," Ferguson said. "Of course," said Catherine, "if it hadn't been crooked we'd never have backed him at all. But I would have liked the three thousand lire." "Let's go down and get a drink and see what they pay," Crowell said. We went out to where they posted the numbers and the bell rang to pay off and they put up 18.50 after Japalac to win. That meant he paid less than even money on a ten-lira bet. We went to the bar under the grand stand and had a whiskey and soda apiece. We ran into a couple of Italians we knew and McAdams, the vice-consul, and they came up with us when we joined the girls. The Italians were full of manners and McAdams talked to Catherine while we went down to bet again. Mr. Mey- ers was standing near the pari-mutual. "Ask him what he played," I said to Crowell. "What are you on, Mr. Meyers?" Crowell asked. Meyers took out his programme and pointed to the number five with his pencil. "Do you mind if we play him too?" Crowell asked. "Go ahead. Go ahead. But don't tell my wife I gave it to you." "Will you have a drink?" I asked. "No thanks. I never drink." We put a hundred lire on number five to win and a hundred to place and then had another whiskey and soda apiece. I was feeling very good and we picked up a couple more Italians, who each had a drink with us, i 4 o A FAREWELL TO ARMS and went back to the girls. These Italians were also very mannered and matched manners with the two we had collected before. In a little while no one could sit down. I gave the tickets to Catherine. "What horse is it?" "I don't know. Mr. Meyers' choice." "Don't you even know the name?" "No. You can find it on the programme. Number five I think." "You have touching faith," she said. The number five won but did not pay anything. Mr. Meyers was angry. "You have to put up two hundred lire to make twenty," he said. "Twelve lire for ten. It's not worth it. My wife lost twenty lire." "I'll go down with you," Catherine said to me. The Italians all stood up. We went downstairs and out to the paddock. "Do you like this?" Catherine asked. "Yes. I guess I do." "It's all right, I suppose," she said. "But, darling, I can't stand to see so many people." "We don't see many." "No. But those Meyers and the man from the bank with his wife and daughters " "He cashes my sight drafts," I said. "Yes but some one else would if he didn't. Those last four boys were awful." "We can stay out here and watch the race from the fence." "That will be lovely. And, darling, let's back a horse we've never heard of and that Mr. Meyers won't be backing." "All right." A FAREWELL TO ARMS i 4 i We backed a horse named Light For Me that fin- ished fourth in a field of five. We leaned on the fence and watched the horses go by, their hoofs thudding as they went past, and saw the mountains off in the dis- tance and Milan beyond the trees and the fields. "I feel so much cleaner/' Catherine said. The horses were coming back, through the gate, wet and sweating, the jockeys quieting them and riding up to dismount under the trees. "Wouldn't you like a drink? We could have one out here and see the horses.' ' 'Til get them," I said. "The boy will bring them," Catherine said. She put her hand up and the boy came out from the Pagoda bar beside the stables. We sat down at a round iron table. "Don't you like it better when we're alone?" "Yes," I said. "I felt very lonely when they were all there." "It's grand here," I said. "Yes. It's really a pretty course." "It's nice." "Don't let me spoil your fun, darling. I'll go back whenever you want." "No," I said. "We'll stay here and have our drink. Then we'll go down and stand at the water jump for the steeplechase." "You're awfully good to me," she said. After we had been alone awhile we were glad to see the others again. We had a good time. CHAPTER XXI In September the first cool nights came, then the days were cool and the leaves on the trees in the park began to turn color and we knew the summer was gone. The fighting at the front went very badly and they could not take San Gabriele. The fighting on the Bain- sizza plateau was over and by the middle of the month the fighting for San Gabriele was about over too. They could not take it. Ettore was gone back to the front. The horses were gone to Rome and there was no more racing. Crowell had gone to Rome too, to be sent back to America. There were riots twice in the town against the war and bad rioting in Turin. A British major at the club told me the Italians had lost one hundred and fifty thousand men on the Bainsizza plateau and on San Gabriele. He said they had lost forty thousand on the Carso besides. We had a drink and he talked. He said the fighting was over for the year down here and that the Italians had bitten off more than they could chew. He said the offensive in Flanders was go- ing to the bad. If they killed men as they did this fall the Allies would be cooked in another year. He said we were all cooked but we were all right as long as we did not know it. We were all cooked. The thing was not to recognize it. The last country to realize they were cooked would win the war. We had another drink. Was I on somebody's staff? No. He was. It was all balls. We were alone in the club sitting back in one of the big leather sofas. His boots were smoothly polished dull leather. They were beautiful boots. He said it was all balls. They thought only in divisions 142 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 143 and man-power. They all squabbled about divisions and only killed them when they got them. They were all cooked. The Germans won the victories. By God they were soldiers. The old Hun was a soldier. But they were cooked too. We were all cooked I asked about Russia. He said they were cooked already. I'd soon see they were cooked. Then the Austrians were cooked too. If they got some Hun divisions they could do it. Did he think they would attack this fall? Of course they would. The Italians were cooked. Every- body knew they were cooked. The old Hun would come down through the Trentino and cut the railway at Vi- cenza and then where would the Italians be? They tried that in 'sixteen, I said. Not with Germans. Yes, I said. But they probably wouldn't do that, he said. It was too simple. They'd try something complicated and get royally cooked. I had to go, I said. I had to get back to the hospital. "Good-by," he said. Then cheerily, "Every sort of luck !" There was a great con- trast between his world pessimism and personal cheeri- ness. I stopped at a barber shop and was shaved and went home to the hospital. My leg was as well as it would get for a long time. I had been up for examination three days before. There were still some treatments to take before my course at the Ospedale Maggiore was finished and I walked along the side street practising not limping. An old man was cutting silhouettes under an arcade. I stopped to watch him. Two girls were posing and he cut their silhouettes together, snipping very fast and looking at them, his head on one side. The girls were giggling. He showed me the silhou- ettes before he pasted them on white paper and handed them to the girls. 144 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 'They're beautiful," he said. "How about you, Tenente ?" The girls went away looking at their silhouettes and laughing. They were nice-looking girls. One of them worked in the wine shop across from the hospital. "All right," I said. "Take your cap off." "No. With it on." "It will not be so beautiful," the old man said. "But," he brightened, "it will be more military." He snipped away at the black paper, then separated the two thicknesses and pasted the profiles on a card and handed them to me. "How much?" "That's all right." He waved his hand. "I just made them for you." "Please." I brought out some coppers. "For plea- sure." "No. I did them for a pleasure. Give them to your girl." "Many thanks until we meet." "Until I see thee." I went on to the hospital. There were some letters, an official one, and some others. I was to have three weeks' convalescent leave and then return to the front. I read it over carefully. Well, that was that. The con- valescent leave started October fourth when my course was finished. Three weeks was twenty-one days. That made October twenty-fifth. I told them I would not be in and went to the restaurant a little way up the street from the hospital for supper and read my letters and the Corriere Delia Sera at the table. There was a letter from my grandfather, containing family news, A FAREWELL TO ARMS 145 patriotic encouragement, a draft for two hundred dol- lars, and a few clippings ; a dull letter from the priest at our mess, a letter from a man I knew who was flying with the French and had gotten in with a wild gang and was telling about it, and a note from Rinaldi ask- ing me how long I was going to skulk in Milano and what was all the news? He wanted me to bring him phonograph records and enclosed a list. I drank a small bottle of chianti with the meal, had a coffee after- ward with a glass of cognac, finished the paper, put my letters in my pocket, left the paper on the table with the tip and went out In my room at the hospital I un- dressed, put on pajamas and a dressing-gown, pulled down the curtains on the door that opened onto the bal- cony and sitting up in bed read Boston papers from a pile Mrs. Meyers had left for her boys at the hospital. The Chicago White Sox were winning the American League pennant and the New York Giants were lead- ing the National League. Babe Ruth was a pitcher then playing for Boston. The papers were dull, the news was local and stale, and the war news was all old. The American news was all training camps. I was glad I wasn't in a training camp. The baseball news was all I could read and I did not have the slightest interest in it. A number of papers together made it impossible to read with interest. It was not very timely but I read at it for a while. I wondered if America really got into the war, if they would close down the major leagues. They probably wouldn't. There was still rac- ing in Milan and the war could not be much worse. They had stopped racing in France. That was where our horse Japalac came from. Catherine was not due on duty until nine o'clock. I heard her passing along the floor when she first came on duty and once saw her 146 A FAREWELL TO ARMS pass in the hall. She went to several other rooms and finally came into mine. "I'm late, darling/' she said. "There was a lot to do. How are you?" I told her about my papers and the leave. "That's lovely," she said. "Where do you want to go?" "Nowhere. I want to stay here." "That's silly. You pick a place to go and I'll come too." "How will you work it?" "I don't know. But I will." "You're pretty wonderful." "No I'm not. But life isn't hard to manage when you've nothing to lose." "How do you mean?" "Nothing. I was only thinking how small obstacles seemed that once were so big." "I should think it might be hard to manage." "No it won't, darling. If necessary I'll simply leave. But it won't come to that." "Where should we go?" "I don't care. Anywhere you want. Anywhere we don't know people." "Don't you care where we go?" "No. I'll like any place." She seemed upset and taut. "What's the matter, Catherine?" "Nothing. Nothing's the matter." "Yes there is." "No nothing. Really nothing." "I know there is. Tell me, darling. You can tell me. It's nothing." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 147 "Tell me." "I don't want to. I'm afraid I'll make you unhappy or worry you." "No it won't." "You're sure? It doesn't worry me but I'm afraid to worry you." "It won't if it doesn't worry you." "I don't want to tell." "Tell it.' "Do I have to?" "Yes." "I'm going to have a baby, darling. It's almost three months along. You're not worried, are you? Please please don't. You mustn't worry." "All right." "Is it all right?" "Of course." "I did everything. I took everything but it didn't make any difference." "I'm not worried." "I couldn't help it, darling, and I haven't worried about it. You mustn't worry or feel badly." "I only worry about you." "That's it. That's what you mustn't do. People have babies all the time. Everybody has babies. It's a natural thing." "You're pretty wonderful." "No I'm not. But you mustn't mind, darling. I'll try and not make trouble for you. I know I've made trouble now. But haven't I been a good girl until now ? You never knew it, did you?" "No." "It will all be like that. You simply mustn't worry. I can see you're worrying. Stop it. Stop it right away. 148 A FAREWELL TO ARMS Wouldn't you like a drink, darling? I know a drink, always makes you feel cheerful." "No. I feel cheerful And you're pretty wonder- ful." "No I'm not. But I'll fix everything to be together if you pick out a place for us to go. It ought to be lovely in October. We'll have a lovely time, darling, and I'll write you every day while you're at the front." "Where will you be?" "I don't know yet. But somewhere splendid. I'll look after all that." We were quiet awhile and did not talk. Catherine was sitting on the bed and I was looking at her but we did not touch each other. We were apart as when some one comes into a room and people are self-conscious. She put out her hand and took mine. "You aren't angry are you, darling?" "No." "And you don't feel trapped ?" "Maybe a little. But not by you." "I didn't mean by me. You mustn't be stupid. I meant trapped at all." "You always feel trapped biologically." She went away a long way without stirring or re- moving her hand. " 'Always' isn't a pretty word." "I'm sorry." "It's all right. But you see I've never had a baby and I've never even loved any one. And I've tried to be the way you wanted and then you talk about 'always.' ' "I could cut off my tongue," I offered. "Oh, darling!" she came back from wherever she had been. "You mustn't mind me." We were both to- gether again and the self -consciousness was gone. "We A FAREWELL TO ARMS 149 really are the same one and we mustn't misunderstand on purpose/ ' "We won't." "But people do. They love each other and they mis- understand on purpose and they fight and then sud- denly they aren't the same one." "We won't fight." "We mustn't. Because there's only us two and in the world there's all the rest of them. If anything comes between us we're gone and then they have us." "They won't get us," I said. "Because you're too brave. Nothing ever happens to the brave." "They die of course." "But only once." "I don't know. Who said that?" "The coward dies a thousand deaths, the brave but one?" "Of course. Who said it?" "I don't know." "He was probably a coward," she said. "He knew a great deal about cowards but nothing about the brave. The brave dies perhaps two thousand deaths if he's in- telligent. He simply doesn't mention them." "I don't know. It's hard to see inside the head of the brave." "Yes. That's how they keep that way." "You're an authority." "You're right, darling. That was deserved." "You're brave." "No," she said. "But I would like to be." "I'm not," I said, "I know where I stand. I've been out long enough to know. I'm like a ball-player that bats two hundred and thirty and knows he's no better." 150 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "What is a ball-player that bats two hundred and thirty? Ifs awfully impressive." "It's not It means a mediocre hitter in baseball." "But still a hitter," she prodded me. "I guess we're both conceited," I said. "But you are brave." "No. But I hope to be." "We're both brave," I said. "And I'm very brave when I've had a drink." "We're splendid people," Catherine said. She went over to the armoire and brought me the cognac and a glass. "Have a drink, darling," she said. "You've been awfully good." "I don't really want one." "Take one." "All right." I poured the water glass a third full of cognac and drank it off. "That was very big," she said. "I know brandy is for heroes. But you shouldn't exaggerate." "Where will we live after the war?" "In an old people's home probably," she said. "For three years I looked forward very childishly to the war ending at Christmas. But now I look forward till when our son will be a lieutenant commander." "Maybe he'll be a general." "If it's an hundred years' war he'll have time to try both of the services." "Don't you want a drink?" "No. It always makes you happy, darling, and it only makes me dizzy." "Didn't you ever drink brandy?" "No, darling. I'm a very old-fashioned wife." I reached down to the floor for the bottle and poured another drink. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 151 "I'd better go to have a look at your compatriots/ ' Catherine said. "Perhaps you'll read the papers until I come back." "Do you have to go?" "Now or later." "All right. Now." "Fll come back later." "Fll have finished the papers/' I said. CHAPTER XXII It turned cold that night and the next day it was raining. Coming home from the Ospedale Maggiore it rained very hard and I was wet when I came in. Up in my room the rain was coming down heavily outside on the balcony, and the wind blew it against the glass doors. I changed my clothing and drank some brandy but the brandy did not taste good. I felt sick in the night and in the morning after breakfast I was nau- seated. "There is no doubt about it," the house surgeon said. "Look at the whites of his eyes, Miss." Miss Gage looked. They had me look in a glass. The whites of the eyes were yellow and it was the jaundice. I was sick for two weeks with it. For that reason we did not spend a convalescent leave together. We had planned to go to Pallanza on Lago Maggiore. It is nice there in the fall when the leaves turn. There are walks you can take and you can troll for trout in the lake. It would have been better than Stresa because there are fewer people at Pallanza. Stresa is so easy to get to from Milan that there are always people you know. There is a nice village at Pallanza and you can row out to the islands where the fishermen live and there is a restaurant on the biggest island. But we did not go. One day while I was in bed with jaundice Miss Van Campen came in the room, opened the door into the armoire and saw the empty bottles there. I had sent a load of them down by the porter and I believe she must have seen them going out and come up to find some 152 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 153 more. They were mostly vermouth bottles, marsala bot- tles, capri bottles, empty chianti flasks and a few cognac bottles. The porter had carried out the large bottles, those that had held vermouth, and the straw-covered chianti flasks, and left the brandy bottles for the last. It was the brandy bottles and a bottle shaped like a bear, which had held kummel, that Miss Van Campen found. The bear-shaped bottle enraged her particularly. She held it up, the bear was sitting up on his haunches with his paw r s up, there was a cork in his glass head and a few sticky crystals at the bottom. I laughed. "It was kummel," I said. "The best kummel comes in those bear-shaped bottles. It comes from Russia." "Those are all brandy bottles, aren't they?" Miss Van Campen asked. "I can't see them all," I said. "But they probably are. "How long has this been going on?" "I bought them and brought them in myself," I said. "I have had Italian officers visit me frequently and I have kept brandy to offer them." "You haven't been drinking it yourself?" she said. "I have also drunk it myself." "Brandy," she said. "Eleven empty bottles of brandy and that bear liquid." "Kummel." "I will send for some one to take them away. Those are all the empty bottles you have?" "For the moment." "And I was pitying you having jaundice. Pity is something that is wasted on you." "Thank you." "I suppose you can't be blamed for not wanting to go back to the front. But I should think you would 154 A FAREWELL TO ARMS try something more intelligent than producing jaun- dice with alcoholism." "With what?" "With alcoholism. You heard me say it." I did not say anything. "Unless you find something else I'm afraid you will have to go back to the front when you are through with your jaundice. I don't believe self-inflicted jaundice entitles you to a convalescent leave." "You don't?" "I do not." "Have you ever had jaundice, Miss Van Campen?" "No, but I have seen a great deal of it." "You noticed how the patients enjoyed it?" "I suppose it is better than the front." "Miss Van Campen," I said, "did you ever know a man who tried to disable himself by kicking himself in the scrotum?" Miss Van Campen ignored the actual question. She had to ignore it or leave the room. She was not ready to leave because she had disliked me for a long time and she was now cashing in. "I have known many men to escape the front through self-inflicted wounds." "That wasn't the question. I have seen self-inflicted wounds also. I asked you if you had ever known a man who had tried to disable himself by kicking him- self in the scrotum. Because that is the nearest sensa- tion to jaundice and it is a sensation that I believe few women have ever experienced. That was why I asked you if you had ever had the jaundice, Miss Van Campen, because â€” " Miss Van Campen left the room. Later Miss Gage came in. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 155 "What did you say to Van Campen ? She was furi- ous." "We were comparing sensations. I was going to suggest that she had never experienced childbirth " "You're a fool/' Gage said. "She's after your scalp." "She has my scalp," I said. "She's lost me my leave and she might try and get me court-martialled. She's mean enough." "She never liked you," Gage said. "What's it about?" "She says I've drunk myself into jaundice so as not to go back to the front." "Pooh," said Gage. "I'll swear you've never taken a drink. Everybody will swear you've never taken a drink." "She found the bottles." "I've told you a hundred times to clear out those bottles. Where are they now?" "In the armoire." "Have you a suitcase?" "No. Put them in that rucksack." Miss Gage packed the bottles in the rucksack. "I'll give them to the porter," she said. She started for the door. "Just a minute," Miss Van Campen said. "I'll take those bottles." She had the porter with her. "Carry them, please," she said. "I want to show them to the doctor when I make my report." She went down the hall. The porter carried the sack. He knew what was in it. Nothing happened except that I lost my leave. CHAPTER XXIII The night I was to return to the front I sent the porter down to hold a seat for me on the train when it came from Turin. The traij?w T as to leave at midnight. It was made up at Turin ailsreached Milan about half- past ten at night and lay in the station until time to leave. You had to be there when it came in, to get a seat. The porter took a friend with him, a machine- gunner on leave who worked in a tailor shop, and was sure that between them they could hold a place. I gave them money for platform tickets and had them take my baggage. There was a big rucksack and two musettes. I said good-by at the hospital at about five o'clock and went out. The porter had my baggage in his lodge T told him I would be at the station a little before rmuiiight. His wife called me "Signorino" and cried. She wiped her eyes and shook hands and then cried again. I patted her on the back and she cried once more. She had done my mending and was a very short dumpy, happy- faced woman with w r hite hair. When she cried her whole face went to pieces. I went down to the corner where there was a wine shop and waited in- side looking out the window. It was dark outside and cold and misty. I paid for my coffee and grappa and I watched the people going by in the light from the window. I saw Catherine and knocked on the window. She looked, saw me and smiled, and I went out to meet her. She was wearing a dark blue cape and a soft felt hat. We walked along together, along the sidewalk past the wine shops, then across the market square and up the street and through the archway to the cathedral 156 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 157 square. There were streetcar tracks and beyond them was the cathedral. It was white and wet in the mist. We crossed the tram tracks. On our left were the shops, their windows lighted, and the entrance to the galleria. There was a fog in the square and when we came close to the front of the cathedral it was very big and the stone was wet. " Would you like to go in?" "No," Catherine said. We walked along. There was a soldier standing with his girl in the shadow of one of the stone buttresses ahead of us and we passed them. They were standing tight up against the stone and he had put his cape around her. "They're like us," I said. "Nobody is like us," Catherine said. She did not mean it happily. "I wish they had some place to go." "It mightn't do them any good." "I don't know. Everybody ought to have some place to go." "They have the cathedral," Catherine said. We were past it now. We crossed the far end of the square and looked back at the cathedral. It was fine in the mist. We were standing in front of the leather goods shop. There were riding boots, a rucksack and ski boots in the window. Each article was set apart as an exhibit ; the rucksack in the centre, the riding boots on one side and the ski boots on the other. The leather was dark and oiled smooth as a used saddle. The electric light made high lights on the dull oiled leather. "We'll ski some time." "In two months there will be ski-ing at Murren," Catherine said. "Let's go there." 158 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "All right/' she said. We went on past other win- dows and turned down a side street. "I've never been this way." "This is the way I go to the hospital," I said. It was a narrow street and we kept on the right-hand side. There were many people passing in the fog. There were shops and all the windows were lighted. We looked in a window at a pile of cheeses. I stopped in front of an armorer's shop. "Come in a minute. I have to buy a gun." "What sort of gun?" "A pistol." We went in and I unbuttoned my belt and laid it with the empty holster on the counter. Two women were behind the counter. The women brought out several pistols. "It must fit this," I said, opening the holster. It was a gray leather holster and I had bought it second- hand to wear in the town. "Have they good pistols?" Catherine asked. "They're all about the same. Can I try this one?" I asked the woman. "I have no place now to shoot," she said. "But it is very good. You will not make a mistake with it." I snapped it and pulled back the action. The spring was rather strong but it worked smoothly. I sighted it and snapped it again. "It is used," the woman said. "It belonged to an of- ficer who was an excellent shot." "Did you sell it to him?" "Yes." "How did you get it back?" "From his orderly." "Maybe you have mine," I said. "How much is this?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 159 "Fifty lire. It is very cheap." "All right. I want two extra clips and a box of cartridges." She brought them from under the counter. "Have you any need for a sword?" she asked. "I have some used swords very cheap." "I'm going to the front*" I said. "Oh yes, then you won't need a sword," she said. I paid for the cartridges and the pistol, filled the magazine and put it in place, put the pistol in my empty holster, filled the extra clips with cartridges and put them in the leather slots on the holster and then buckled on my belt The pistol felt heavy on the belt. Still, I thought, it was better to have a regulation pistol. You could always get shells, "Now we're fully armed," I said. "That was the one thing I had to remember to do. Some one got my other one going to the hospital." "I hope it's a good pistol," Catherine said. "Was there anything else?" the woman asked. "I don't believe so." "The pistol has a lanyard," she said. "So I noticed." The woman wanted to sell some- thing else. "You don't need a whistle?" "I don't believe so." The woman said good-by and we went out onto the sidewalk. Catherine looked in the window. The wo- man looked out and bowed to us. "What are those little mirrors set in wood for?" "They're for attracting birds. They twirl them out in the field and larks see them and come out and the Italians shoot them." "They are an ingenious people," Catherine said. i6o A FAREWELL TO ARMS "You don't shoot larks do you, darling, in America ?" "Not especially." We crossed the street and started to walk up the other side. "I feel better now/' Catherine said. "I felt terrible when we started." "We always feel good when we're together." "We always will be together." "Yes, except that I'm going away at midnight." "Don't think about it, darling." We walked on up the street. The fog made the lights yellow. "Aren't you tired?" Catherine asked. "How about you?" "I'm all right. It's fun to walk." "But let's not do it too long." "No." We turned down a side street where there were no lights and walked in the street. I stopped and kissed Catherine. While I kissed her I felt her hand on my shoulder. She had pulled my cape around her so it covered both of us. We were standing in the street against a high wall. "Let's go some place," I said. "Good," said Catherine. We walked on along the street until it came out onto a wider street that was beside a canal. On the other side was a brick wall and buildings. Ahead, down the street, I saw a street-car cross a bridge. "We can get a cab up at the bridge," I said. We stood on the bridge in the fog waiting for a carriage. Several street-cars passed, full of people going home. Then a carriage came along but there was some one in it. The fog was turning to rain. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 161 "We could walk or take a tram," Catherine said. "One will be along," I said. "They go by here." "Here one comes," she said. The driver stopped his horse and lowered the metal sign on his meter. The top of the carriage was up and there were drops of water on the driver's coat. His varnished hat was shining in the wet. We sat back in the seat together and the top of the carriage made it dark. "Where did you tell him to go?" "To the station. There's a hotel across from the sta- tion where we can go." "We can go the way we are? Without luggage?" "Yes," I said. It was a long ride to the station up side streets in the rain. "Won't we have dinner?" Catherine asked. "I'm afraid I'll be hungry." "We'll have it in our room." "I haven't anything to wear. I haven't even a night- gown." "We'll get one," I said and called to the driver. "Go to the Via Manzoni and up that." He nodded and turned off to the left at the next corner. On the big street Catherine watched for a shop. "Here's a place," she said. I stopped the driver and Catherine got out, walked across the sidewalk and went inside. I sat back in the carriage and waited for her. It was raining and I could smell the wet street and the horse steaming in the rain. She came back with a package and got in and we drove on. "I was very extravagant, darling," she said, "but it's a fine nightgown." At the hotel I asked Catherine to wait in the carriage 162 A FAREWELL TO ARMS while I went in and spoke to the manager. There were plenty of rooms. Then I went out to the carriage, paid the driver, and Catherine and I walked in together. The small boy in buttons carried the package. The manager bowed us toward the elevator. There was much red plush and brass. The manager went up in the elevator with us. "Monsieur and Madame wish dinner in their room?" "Yes. Will you have the menu brought up?" I said. "You wish something special for dinner. Some game or a soufflet?" The elevator passed three floors with a click each time, then clicked and stopped. "What have you as game?" "I could get a pheasant, or a woodcock." "A woodcock," I said. We walked down the corri- dor. The carpet was worn. There were many doors. The manager stopped and unlocked a door and opened it. "Here you are. A lovely room." The small boy in buttons put the package on the table in the centre of the room. The manager opened the curtains. "It is foggy outside," he said. The room was fur- nished in red plush. There were many mirrors, two chairs and a large bed with a satin coverlet. A door led to the bathroom. "I will send up the menu," the manager said. He bowed and went out. I went to the window and looked out, then pulled a cord that shut the thick plush curtains. Catherine was sitting on the bed, looking at the cut glass chandelier. She had taken her hat off and her hair shone under the light. She saw herself in one of the mirrors and put her hands to her hair. I saw her in three other mir- A FAREWELL TO ARMS 163 rors. She did not look happy. She let her cape fall on the bed. " What's the matter, darling ?" "I never felt like a whore before," she said. I went over to the window and pulled the curtain aside and looked out I had not thought it would be like this. "You're not a whore/' "I know it, darling. But it isn't nice to feel like one." Her voice was dry and flat. "This was the best hotel we could get in," I said. I looked out the window. Across the square were the lights of the station. There were carriages going by on the street and I saw the trees in the park. The lights from the hotel shone on the wet pavement. Oh, hell, I thought, do we have to argue now ? "Come over here please," Catherine said. The flat- ness was all gone out of her voice. "Come over, please. I'm a good girl again." I looked over at the bed. She was smiling. I went over and sat on the bed beside her and kissed her. "You're my good girl." "I'm certainly yours," she said. After we had eaten we felt fine, and then after, we felt very happy and in a little time the room felt like our own home. My room at the hospital had been our own home and this room was our home too in the same way. Catherine wore my tunic over her shoulders while we ate. We were very hungry and the meal was good and we drank a bottle of Capri and a bottle of St. Estephe. I drank most of it but Catherine drank some and it made her feel splendid. For dinner we had a 164 A FAREWELL TO ARMS woodcock with souffle potatoes and puree de marron, a salad, and zabaione for dessert. "It's a fine room," Catherine said. "It's a lovely room. We should have stayed here all the time we've been in Milan." "It's a funny room. But it's nice." "Vice is a wonderful thing," Catherine said. "The people who go in for it seem to have good taste about it. The red plush is really fine. It's just the thing. And the mirrors are very attractive." "You're a lovely girl." "I don't know how a room like this would be for waking up in the morning. But it's really a splendid room." I poured another glass of St. Estephe. "I wish we could do something really sinful," Cath- erine said. "Everything we do seems so innocent and simple. I can't believe we do anything wrong." "You're a grand girl." "I only feel hungry. I get terribly hungry." "You're a fine simple girl," I said. "I am a simple girl. No one ever understood it ex- cept you." "Once when I first met you I spent an afternoon thinking how we would go to the Hotel Cavour to- gether and how it would be." "That was awfully cheeky of you. This isn't the Cavour is it?" "No. They wouldn't have taken us in there." "They'll take us in some time. But that's how we differ, darling. I never thought about anything." "Didn't you ever at all?" "A little," she said. "Oh you're a lovely girl." I poured another glass of wine. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 165 "I'm a very simple girl," Catherine said. "I didn't think so at first. I thought you were a crazy girl." ''I was a little crazy. But I wasn't crazy in any com- plicated manner. I didn't confuse you did I, darling?" "Wine is a grand thing," I said. "It makes you for- get all the bad." "It's lovely," said Catherine. "But it's given my fa- ther gout very badly." "Have you a father?" "Yes," said Catherine. "He has gout. You won't ever have to meet him. Haven't you a father?" "No," I said. "A step-father." "Will I like him?" "You won't have to meet him." "We have such a fine time," Catherine said. "I don't take any interest in anything else any more. I'm so very happy married to you." The waiter came and took away the things. After a while we were very still and we could hear the rain. Down below on the street a motor car honked. " 'But at my back I always hear Time's winged chariot hurrying near/ " I said. "I know that poem," Catherine said. "It's by Marvell. But it's about a girl who wouldn't live with a man." My head felt very clear and cold and I wanted to talk facts. "Where will you have the baby?" "I don't know. The best place I can find." "How will you arrange it?" "The best way I can. Don't worry, darling. We may have several babies before the war is over." 1 66 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "It's nearly time to go." "I know. You can make it time if you want." "No." "Then don't worry, darling. You were fine until now and now you're worrying." "I won't. How often will you write?" "Every day. Do they read your letters?" "They can't read English enough to hurt any." "I'll make them very confusing," Catherine said. "But not too confusing." "I'll just make them a little confusing." "I'm afraid we have to start to go." "All right, darling." "I hate to leave our fine house." "So do I." "But we have to go." "AH right. But we're never settled in our home very long." "We will be." "I'll have a fine home for you when you come back." "Maybe I'll be back right away." "Perhaps you'll be hurt just a little in the foot." "Or the lobe of the ear." "No I want your ears the way they are." "And not my feet?" "Your feet have been hit already." "We have to go, darling. Really." "All right. You go first." CHAPTER XXIV We walked down the stairs instead of taking the elevator. The carpet on the stairs was worn. I had paid for the dinner when it came up and the waiter, who had brought it, was sitting on a chair near the door. He jumped up and bowed and I went with him into the side room and paid the bill for the room. The manager had remembered me as a friend and refused payment in advance but when he retired he had remem- bered to have the waiter stationed at the door so that I should not get out without paying. I suppose that had happened ; even with his friends. One had so many friends in a war. I asked the waiter to get us a carriage and he took Catherine's package that I was carrying and went out with an umbrella. Outside through the window we saw him crossing the street in the rain. We stood in the side room and looked out the window. "How do you feel, Cat?" "Sleepy." "I feel hollow and hungry." "Have you anything to eat?" "Yes, in my musette." I saw the carriage coming. It stopped, the horse's head hanging in the rain, and the waiter stepped out, opened his umbrella, and came toward the hotel. We met him at the door and walked out under the um- brella down the wet walk to the carriage at the curb. Water was running in the gutter. "There is your package on the seat," the waiter said. He stood with the umbrella until we were in and I had tipped him. 167 168 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Many thanks. Pleasant journey," he said. The coachman lifted the reins and the horse started. The waiter turned away under the umbrella and went to- ward the hotel. We drove down the street and turned to the left, then came around to the right in front of the station. There were two carabinieri standing under the light just out of the rain. The light shone on their hats. The rain was clear and transparent against the light from the station. A porter came out from under the shelter of the station, his shoulders up against the rain. "No," I said. "Thanks. I don't need thee." He went back under the shelter of the archway. I turned to Catherine. Her face was in the shadow from the hood of the carriage. "We might as well say good-by." "I can't go in?" "No." "Good-by, Cat." "Will you tell him the hospital?" "Yes." I told the driver the address to drive to. He nodded. "Good-by," I said. "Take good care of yourself and young Catherine." "Good-by, darling." "Good-by," I said. I stepped out into the rain and the carriage started. Catherine leaned out and I saw her face in the light. She smiled and waved. The carriage went up the street, Catherine pointed in to- ward the archway. I looked, there were only the two carabinieri and the archway. I realized she meant for me to get in out of the rain. I went in and stood and watched the carriage turn the corner. Then I started A FAREWELL TO ARMS 169 through the station and down the runway to the train. The porter was on the platform looking for me. I followed him into the train, crowding past people and along the aisle and in through a door to where the machine-gunner sat in the corner of a full compart- ment. My rucksack and musettes were above his head on the luggage rack. There were many men standing in the corridor and the men in the compartment all looked at us when we came in. There were not enough places in the train and every one was hostile. The ma- chine-gunner stood up for me to sit down. Some one tapped me on the shoulder. I looked around. It was a very tall gaunt captain of artillery with a red scar along his jaw. He had looked through the glass on the corridor and then come in. "What do you say?" I asked. I had turned and faced him. He was taller than I and his face was very thin under the shadow of his cap-visor and the' scar was new and shiny. Every one in the compart- ment was looking at me. "You can't do that," he said. "You can't have a soldier save you a place." "I have done it." He swallowed and I saw his Adam's apple go up and then down. The machine-gunner stood in front of the place. Other men looked in through the glass. No one in the compartment said anything. "You have no right to do that. I was here two hours before you came." "What do you want?" "The seat." "So do I." I watched his face and could feel the whole com- partment against me. I did not blame them. He was 170 A FAREWELL TO ARMS in the right. But I wanted the seat. Still no one said anything. Oh, hell, I thought. "Sit down, Signor Capitano," I said. The machine- gunner moved out of the way and the tall captain sat down. He looked at me. His face seemed hurt. But he had the seat "Get my things," I said to the ma- chine-gunner. We went out in the corridor. The train was full and I knew there was no chance of a place. I gave the porter and the machine-gunner ten lire apiece. They went down the corridor and outside on the plat- form looking in the windows but there were no places. "Maybe some will get off at Brescia," the porter said. "More will get on at Brescia," said the machine- gunner. I said good-by to them and we shook hands and they left They both felt badly. Inside the train we were all standing in the corridor when the train started. I watched the lights of the station and the yards as we went out. It was still raining and soon the windows were wet and you could not see out. Later I slept on the floor of the corridor; first putting my pocket-book with my money and papers in it inside my shirt and trousers so that it was inside the leg of my breeches. I slept all night, waking at Brescia and Verona when more men got on the train, but going back to sleep at once. I had my head on one of the musettes and my arms around the other and I could feel the pack and they could all walk over me if they wouldn't step on me. Men were sleeping on the floor all down the corridor. Others stood holding on to the window rods or leaning against the doors. That train was al- ways crowded. BOOK III CHAPTER XXV Now in the fall the trees were all bare and the roads were muddy. I rode to Gorizia from Udine on a camion. We passed other camions on the road and I looked at the country. The mulberry trees were bare and the fields were brown. There were wet dead leaves on the road from the rows of bare trees and men were working on the road, tamping stone in the ruts from piles of crushed stone along the side of the road be- tween the trees. We saw the town with a mist over it that cut off the mountains. We crossed the river and I saw that it was running high. It had been raining in the mountains. We came into the town past the fac- tories and then the houses and villas and I saw that many more houses had been hit On a narrow street we passed a British Red Cross ambulance. The driver wore a cap and his face was thin and very tanned. I did not know him. I got down from the camion in the big square in front of the Town Major's house, the driver handed down my rucksack and I put it on and swung on the two musettes and walked to our villa. It did not feel like a homecoming. I walked down the damp gravel driveway looking at the villa through the trees. The windows were all shut but the door was open. I went in and found the major sitting at a table in the bare room with maps and typed sheets of paper on the wall. "Hello," he said. "How are you?" He looked older and drier. "I'm good," I said. "How is everything?" "It's all over," he said. "Take off your kit and sit 173 174 A FAREWELL TO ARMS down." I put my pack and the two musettes on the floor and my cap on the pack. I brought the other chair over from the wall and sat down by the desk. "It's been a bad summer," the major said. "Are you strong now ?" "Yes." "Did you ever get the decorations?" "Yes. I got them fine. Thank you very much." "Let's see them." I opened my cape so he could see the two ribbons. "Did you get the boxes with the medals?" "No. Just the papers." "The boxes will come later. That takes more time." "What do you want me to do?" "The cars are all away. There are six up north at Caporetto. You know Caporetto?" "Yes," I said. I remembered it as a little white town with a campanile in a valley. It was a clean little town and there was a fine fountain in the square. "They are working from there. There are many sick now. The fighting is over." "Where are the others?" "There are two up in the mountains and four still on the Bainsizza. The other two ambulance sections are in the Carso with the third army." "What do you wish me to do?" "You can go and take over the four cars on the Bainsizza if you like. Gino has been up there a long time. You haven't seen it up there, have you?" "No." "It was very bad. We lost three cars." "I heard about it." "Yes, Rinaldi wrote you." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 175 "Where is Rinaldi?" "He is here at the hospital. He has had a summer and fall of it" "I believe it." "It has been bad," the major said. "You couldn't believe how bad it's been. I've often thought you were lucky to be hit when you were." "I know I was." "Next year will be worse," the major said. "Per- haps they will attack now. They say they are to attack but I can't believe it. It is too late. You saw the river?" "Yes. It's high already." "I don't believe they will attack now that the rains have started. We will have the snow soon. What about your countrymen? Will there be other Ameri- cans besides yourself?" "They are training an army of ten million." "I hope we get some of them. But the French will hog them all. We'll never get any down here. All right. You stay here to-night and go out to-morrow with the little car and send Gino back. I'll send some- body with you that knows the road. Gino will tell you everything. They are shelling quite a little still but it is all over. You will want to see the Bainsizza." "I'm glad to see it. I am glad to be back with you again, Signor Maggiore." He smiled. "You are very good to say so. I am very tired of this war* If I was away I do not believe I would come back." "Is it so bad?" "Yes. It is so bad and worse. Go get cleaned up and find your friend Rinaldi." I went out and carried my bags up the stairs. Ri- 176 A FAREWELL TO ARMS naldi was not in the room but his things were there and I sat down on the bed and unwrapped my puttees and took the shoe off my right foot. Then I lay back on the bed. I was tired and my right foot hurt. It seemed silly to lie on the bed with one shoe off, so I sat up and unlaced the other shoe and dropped it on the floor, then lay back on the blanket again. The room was stuffy with the window closed but I was too tired to get up and open it. I saw my things were all in one corner of the room. Outside it was getting dark. I lay on the bed and thought about Catherine and waited for Ri- naldi. I was going to try not to think about Catherine except at night before I went to sleep. But now I was tired and there was nothing to do, so I lay and thought about her. I was thinking about her when Rinaldi came in. He looked just the same. Perhaps he was a little thinner. "Well, baby," he said. I sat up on the bed. He came over, sat down and put his arm around me. "Good old baby." He whacked me on the back and I held both his arms. "Old baby," he said. "Let me see your knee." "I'll have to take off my pants." "Take off your pants, baby. We're all friends here. I want to see what kind of a job they did." I stood up, took off the breeches and pulled off the knee-brace. Rinaldi sat on the floor and bent the knee gently back and forth. He ran his finger along the scar; put his thumbs together over the kneecap and rocked the knee gently with his fingers. "Is that all the articulation you have?" "Yes." "It's a crime to send you back. They ought to get complete articulation." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 177 "It's a lot better than it was. It was stiff as a board." Rinaldi bent it more. I watched his hands. He had fine surgeon's hands. I looked at the top of his head, his hair shiny and parted smoothly. He bent the knee too far. "Ouch!" I said. "You ought to have more treatment on it with the machines," Rinaldi said. "It's better than it was." "I see that, baby. This is something I know more about than you." He stood up and sat down on the bed. "The knee itself is a good job." He was through with the knee. "Tell me all about everything." "There's nothing to tell," I said. "I've led a quiet life." "You act like a married man," he said. "What's the matter with you?" "Nothing," I said. "What's the matter with you?" "This war is killing me," Rinaldi said, "I am very depressed by it." He folded his hands over his knee. "Oh," I said. "What's the matter? Can't I even have human im- pulses ?" "No. I can see you've been having a fine time. Tell me. "All summer and all fall I've operated. I work all the time. I do everybody's work. All the hard ones they leave to me. By God, baby, I am becoming a lovely surgeon." "That sounds better." "I never think. No, by God, I don't think; I oper- ate." "That's right." 178 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "But now, baby, it's all over. I don't operate now and I feel like hell. This is a terrible war, baby. You believe me when I say it. Now you cheer me up. Did you bring the phonograph records ?" "Yes," They were wrapped in paper in a cardboard box in my rucksack. I was too tired to get them out. "Don't you feel good yourself, baby?" "I feel like hell." "This war is terrible," Rinaldi said. "Come on. We'll both get drunk and be cheerful. Then we'll go get the ashes dragged. Then we'll feel fine." "I've had the jaundice," I said, "and I can't get drunk." "Oh, baby, how you've come back to me. You come back serious and with a liver. I tell you this war is a bad thing. Why did we make it anyway?" "We'll have a drink. I don't want to get drunk but we'll have a drink." Rinaldi went across the room to the washstand and brought back two glasses and a bottle of cognac. "It's Austrian cognac," he said. "Seven stars. It's all they captured on San Gabriele." "Were you up there?" "No. I haven't been anywhere. I've been here all the time operating. Look, baby, this is your old tooth- brushing glass. I kept it all the time to remind me of you." "To remind you to brush your teeth." "No. I have my own too. I kept this to remind me of you trying to brush away the Villa Rossa from your teeth in the morning, swearing and eating aspi- rin and cursing harlots. Every time I see that glass I think of you trying to clean your conscience with a A FAREWELL TO ARMS 179 toothbrush." He came over to the bed. "Kiss me once and tell me you're not serious." "I never kiss you. You're an ape." "I know, you are the fine good Anglo-Saxon boy. I know. You are the remorse boy, I know. I will wait till I see the Anglo-Saxon brushing away harlotry with a toothbrush." "Put some cognac in the glass." We touched glasses and drank. Rinaldi laughed at me. "I will get you drunk and take out your liver and put you in a good Italian liver and make you a man again." I held the glass for some more cognac. It was dark outside now. Holding the glass of cognac, I went over and opened the window. The rain had stopped falling. It was colder outside and there was a mist in the trees. "Don't throw the cognac out the window," Rinaldi said. "If you can't drink it give it to me." "Go something yourself," I said. I was glad to see Rinaldi again. He had spent two years teasing me and I had always liked it. We understood each other very well. "Are you married?" he asked from the bed. I was standing against the wall by the window. "Not yet." "Are you in love?" "Yes." "With that English girl?" "Yes." "Poor baby. Is she good to you?" "Of course." "I mean is she good to you practically speaking?" "Shut up." 180 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "I will. You will see I am a man of extreme deli- cacy. Does she ?" "Rinin," I said. "Please shut up. If you want to be my friend, shut up." "I don't want to be your friend, baby. I am your friend." "Then shut up." "All right." I went over to the bed and sat down beside Rinaldi. He was holding his glass and looking at the floor. "You see how it is, Rinin?" "Oh, yes. All my life I encounter sacred subjects. But very few with you. I suppose you must have them too." He looked at the floor. "You haven't any?" "No." "Not any?" "No." "I can say this about your mother and that about your sister?" "And that about your sister/' Rinaldi said swiftly. We both laughed. "The old superman," I said. "I am jealous maybe," Rinaldi said. "No, you're not." "I don't mean like that. I mean something else. Have you any married friends?" "Yes," I said. "I haven't," Rinaldi said. "Not if they love each other." "Why not?" "They don't like me." "Why not?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 181 "I am the snake. I am the snake of reason." "You're getting it mixed. The apple was reason." "No, it was the snake." He was more cheerful. "You are better when you don't think so deeply," I said. "I love you, baby," he said. "You puncture me when I become a great Italian thinker. But I know many things I can't say. I know more than you." "Yes. You do." "But you will have a better time. Even with re- morse you will have a better time." "I don't think so." "Oh, yes. That is true. Already I am only happy when I am working." He looked at the floor again. "You'll get over that." "No. I only like two other things; one is bad for my work and the other is over in half an hour or fifteen minutes. Sometimes less." "Sometimes a good deal less." "Perhaps I have improved, baby. You do not know. But there are only the two things and my work." "You'll get other things." "No. We never get anything. We are born with all we have and we never learn. We never get anything new. We all start complete. You should be glad not to be a Latin." "There's no such thing as a Latin. That is 'Latin' thinking. You are so proud of your defects." Rinaldi looked up and laughed. "We'll stop, baby. I am tired from thinking so much." He had looked tired when he came in. "It's nearly time to eat. I'm glad you're back. You are my best friend and my war brother." "When do the war brothers eat?" I asked. 182 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Right away. We'll drink once more for your liver's sake." "Like Saint Paul." "You are inaccurate. That was wine and the stom- ach. Take a little wine for your stomach's sake." "Whatever you have in the bottle," I said. "For any sake you mention." "To your girl," Rinaldi said. He held out his glass. "All right." "I'll never say a dirty thing about her." "Don't strain yourself." He drank off the cognac. "I am pure," he said. "I am like you, baby. I will get an English girl too. As a matter of fact I knew your girl first but she was a little tall for me. A tall girl for a sister," he quoted. "You have a lovely pure mind," I said. "Haven't I ? That's why they call me Rinaldo Puris- simo." "Rinaldo Sporchissimo." "Come on, baby, we'll go down to eat while my mind is still pure." I washed, combed my hair and we went down the stairs. Rinaldi was a little drunk. In the room where we ate, the meal was not quite ready. "I'll go get the bottle," Rinaldi said. He went off up the stairs. I sat at the table and he came back with the bottle and poured us each a half tumbler of cognac. "Too much," I said and held up the glass and sighted at the lamp on the table. "Not for an empty stomach. It is a wonderful thing. It burns out the stomach completely. Nothing is worse for you." "All right." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 183 "Self-destruction day by day," Rinaldi said. "It ruins the stomach and makes the hand shake. Just the thing for a surgeon." "You recommend it?" "Heartily. I use no other. Drink it down, baby, and look forward to being sick." I drank half the glass. In the hall I could hear the orderly calling. "Soup! Soup is ready!" The major came in, nodded to us and sat down. He seemed very small at table. "Is this all we are?" he asked. The orderly put the soup bowl down and he ladled out a plate full. "We are all," Rinaldi said. "Unless the priest comes. If he knew Federico was here he would be here." "Where is he?" I asked. "He's at 307," the major said. He was busy with his soup. He wiped his mouth, wiping his upturned gray mustache carefully. "He will come I think. I called them and left word to tell him you were here." "I miss the noise of the mess," I said. "Yes, it's quiet," the major said. "I will be noisy," said Rinaldi. "Drink some wine, Enrico," said the major. He filled my glass. The spaghetti came in and we were all busy. We were finishing the spaghetti when the priest came in. He was the same as ever, small and brown and compact looking. I stood up and we shook hands. He put his hand on my shoulder. "I came as soon as I heard," he said. "Sit down," the major said. "You're late." "Good-evening, priest," Rinaldi said, using the Eng- lish word. They had taken that up from the priest-bait- ing captain, who spoke a little English. "Good-evening, i8 4 A FAREWELL TO ARMS Rinaldo," the priest said. The orderly brought him soup but he said he would start with the spaghetti. "How are you?" he asked me. "Fine," I said. "How have things been?" "Drink some wine, priest," Rinaldi said. "Take a lit- tle wine for your stomach's sake. That's Saint Paul, you know." "Yes I know," said the priest politely. Rinaldi filled his glass. "That Saint Paul," said Rinaldi. "He's the one who makes all the trouble." The priest looked at me and smiled. I could see that the baiting did not touch him now. "That Saint Paul," Rinaldi said. "He was a rounder and a chaser and then when he was no longer hot he said it was no good. When he was finished he made the rules for us who are still hot. Isn't it true, Fede- rico?" The major smiled. We were eating meat stew now. "I never discuss a Saint after dark," I said. The priest looked up from the stew and smiled at me. "There he is, gone over with the priest," Rinaldi said. "Where are all the good old priest-baiters? Where is Cavalcanti? Where is Brundi? Where is Cesare? Do I have to bait this priest alone without support?" "He is a good priest," said the major. "He is a good priest," said Rinaldi. "But still a priest. I try to make the mess like the old days. I want to make Federico happy. To hell with you, priest!" I saw the major look at him and notice that he was drunk. His thin face was white. The line of his hair was very black against the white of his forehead. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 185 "It's all right, Rinaldo," said the priest. "It's all right." "To hell with you," said Rinaldi. "To hell with the whole damn business." He sat back in his chair. "He's been under a strain and he's tired," the major said to me. He finished his meat and wiped up the gravy with a piece of bread. "I don't give a damn," Rinaldi said to the table. "To hell with the whole business." He looked defiantly around the table, his eyes flat, his face pale. "All right," I said. "To hell with the whole damn business." "No, no," said Rinaldi. "You can't do it. You can't do it. I say you can't do it. You're dry and you're empty and there's nothing else. There's nothing else I tell you. Not a damned thing. I know, when I stop working." The priest shook his head. The orderly took away the stew dish. "What are you eating meat for?" Rinaldi turned to the priest. "Don' you know it's Friday?" "It's Thursday," the priest said. "It's a lie. It's Friday. You're eating the body of our Lord. It's God-meat. I know. It's dead Austrian. That's what you're eating." "The white meat is from officers," I said, completing the old joke. Rinaldi laughed. He filled his glass. "Don't mind me," he said. "I'm just a little crazy." "You ought to have a leave," the priest said. The major shook his head at him. Rinaldi looked at the priest. "You think I ought to have a leave?" 186 A FAREWELL TO ARMS The major shook his head at the priest. Rinaldi was looking at the priest. "Just as you like/' the priest said. "Not if you don't want." "To hell with you," Rinaldi said. "They try to get rid of me. Every night they try to get rid of me. I fight them off. What if I have it. Everybody has it. The whole world's got it. First," he went on, assum- ing the manner of a lecturer, "it's a little pimple. Then we notice a rash between the shoulders. Then we notice nothing at all. We put our faith in mercury." "Or salvarsan," the major interrupted quietly. "A mercurial product," Rinaldi said. He acted very elated now. "I know something worth two of that. Good old priest," he said. "You'll never get it. Baby will get it. It's an industrial accident. It's a simple industrial accident." The orderly brought in the sweet and coffee. The dessert was a sort of black bread pudding with hard sauce. The lamp was smoking ; the black smoke going close up inside the chimney. "Bring two candles and take away the lamp," the major said. The orderly brought two lighted candles each in a saucer, and took out the lamp blowing it out. Rinaldi was quiet now. He seemed all right. We talked and after the coffee we all went out into the hall. "You want to talk to the priest. I have to go in the town," Rinaldi said. "Good-night, priest." "Good-night, Rinaldo," the priest said. "I'll see you Fredi," Rinaldi said. "Yes," I said. "Come in early." He made a face and went out the door. The major was standing with us. "He's very tired and overworked," he said. "He thinks too he has syphilis. I don't believe it but he may have. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 187 He is treating himself for it. Good-night. You will leave before daylight, Enrico ?" "Yes." "Good-by then," he said. "Good luck. Peduzzi will wake you and go with you." "Good-by, Signor Maggiore." "Good-by. They talk about an Austrian offensive but I don't believe it. I hope not. But anyway it won't be here. Gino will tell you everything. The telephone works well now." 'Til call regularly." "Please do. Good-night. Don't let Rinaldi drink so much brandy." "I'll try not to." "Good-night, priest." "Good-night, Signor Maggiore." He went off into his office. CHAPTER XXVI I went to the door and looked out. It had stopped raining but there was a mist. "Should we go upstairs ?" I asked the priest. "I can only stay a little while." "Come on up." We climbed the stairs and went into my room. I lay down on Rinaldi's bed. The priest sat on my cot that the orderly had set up. It was dark in the room. "Well," he said, "how are you really?" "I'm all right. I'm tired to-night." "I'm tired too, but from no cause." "What about the war?" "I think it will be over soon. I don't know why, but I feel it." "How do you feel it?" "You know how your major is? Gentle? Many people are like that now." "I feel that way myself," I said. "It has been a terrible summer," said the priest. He was surer of himself now than when I had gone away. "You cannot believe how it has been. Except that you have been there and you know how it can be. Many people have realized the war this summer. Officers whom I thought could never realize it realize it now." "What will happen?" I stroked the blanket with my hand. "I do not know but I do not think it can go on much longer." "What will happen?" "They will stop fighting." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 189 "Who?" "Both sides." "I hope so," I said. "You don't believe it?" "I don't believe both sides will stop fighting at once." "I suppose not. It is too much to expect. But when I see the changes in men I do not think it can go on." "Who won the fighting this summer?" "No one." "The Austrians won," I said. "They kept them from taking San Gabriele. They've won. They won't stop fighting." "If they feel as we feel they may stop. They have gone through the same thing." "No one ever stopped when they were winning." "You discourage me." "I can only say what I think." "Then you think it will go on and on? Nothing will ever happen?" "I don't know. I only think the Austrians will not stop when they have won a victory. It is in defeat that we become Christian." "The Austrians are Christians â€” except for the Bos- nians." "I don't mean technically Christian. I mean like Our Lord." He said nothing. "We are all gentler now because we are beaten. How would Our Lord have been if Peter had rescued him in the Garden?" "He would have been just the same." "I don't think so," I said. "You discourage me," he said. "I believe and I pray that something will happen. I have felt it very close." 190 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Something may happen," I said. "But it will hap- pen only to us. If they felt the way we do, it would be all right. But they have beaten us. They feel another way." "Many of the soldiers have always felt this way. It is not because they were beaten." "They were beaten to start with. They were beaten when they took them from their farms and put them in the army. That is why the peasant has wisdom, be- cause he is defeated from the start. Put him in power and see how wise he is." He did not say anything. He was thinking. "Now I am depressed myself," I said. "That's why I never think about these things. I never think and yet when I begin to talk I say the things I have found out in my mind without thinking." "I had hoped for something." "Defeat?" "No. Something more." "There isn't anything more. Except victory. It may be worse." "I hoped for a long time for victory." "Me too." "Now I don't know." "It has to be one or the other." "I don't believe in victory any more." "I don't. But I don't believe in defeat. Though it may be better." "What do you believe in ?" "In sleep," I said. He stood up. "I am very sorry to have stayed so long. But I like so to talk with you." "It is very nice to talk again. I said that about sleep- ing, meaning nothing." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 191 We stood up and shook hands in the dark. "I sleep at 307 now," he said. "I go out on post early to-morrow." 'Til see you when you come back." "We'll have a walk and talk together." I walked with him to the door. "Don't go down," he said. "It is very nice that you are back. Though not so nice for you." He put his hand on my shoulder. "It's all right for me," I said. "Good-night." "Good-night. Ciaou !" "Ciaou !" I said. I was deadly sleepy. CHAPTER XXVII I woke when Rinaldi came in but he did not talk and I went back to sleep again. In the morning I was dressed and gone before it was light. Rinaldi did not wake when I left. I had not seen the Bainsizza before and it was strange to go up the slope where the Austrians had been, be- yond the place on the river where I had been wounded. There was a steep new road and many trucks. Beyond, the road flattened out and I saw woods and steep hills in the mist. There were woods that had been taken quickly and not smashed. Then beyond where the road was not protected by the hills it was screened by mat- ting on the sides and over the top. The road ended in a wrecked village. The lines were up beyond. There was much artillery around. The houses were badly smashed but things were very well organized and there were signboards everywhere. We found Gino and he got us some coffee and later I went with him and met various people and saw the posts. Gino said the Brit- ish cars were working further down the Bainsizza at Ravne. He had great admiration for the British. There was still a certain amount of shelling, he said, but not many wounded. There would be many sick now the rains had started. The Austrians were supposed to at- tack but he did not believe it. We were supposed to at- tack too, but they had not brought up any new troops so he thought that was off too. Food was scarce and he would be glad to get a full meal in Gorizia. What kind of supper had I had? I told him and he said that 192 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 193 would be wonderful. He was especially impressed by the dolce. I did not describe it in detail, only said it was a dolce, and I think he believed it was something more elaborate than bread pudding. Did I know where he was going to go? I said I didn't but that some of the other cars were at Capo- retto. He hoped he would go up that way. It was a nice little place and he liked the high mountain hauling up beyond. He was a nice boy and every one seemed to like him. He said where it really had been hell was at San Gabriele and the attack beyond Lorn that had gone bad. He said the Austrians had a great amount of artillery in the woods along Ternova ridge beyond and above us, and shelled the roads badly at night. There was a battery of naval guns that had gotten on his nerves. I would recognize them because of their flat trajectory. You heard the report and then the shriek commenced almost instantly. They usually fired two guns at once, one right after the other, and the fragments from the burst were enormous. He showed me one, a smoothly jagged piece of metal over a foot long. It looked like babbiting metal. "I don't suppose they are so effective," Gino said. "But they scare me. They all sound as though they came directly for you. There is the boom, then in- stantly the shriek and burst. What's the use of not be- ing wounded if they scare you to death?" He said there were Croats in the lines opposite us now and some Magyars. Our troops were still in the attacking positions. There was no wire to speak of and no place to fall back to if there should be an Austrian attack. There were fine positions for defense along the low mountains that came up out of the plateau but nothing had been done about organizing them for de- 194 A FAREWELL TO ARMS fense. What did I think about the Bainsizza anyway? I had expected it to be flatter, more like a plateau. I had not realized it was so broken up. "Alto piano," Gino said, "but no piano." We went back to the cellar of the house where he lived. I said I thought a ridge that flattened out on top and had a little depth would be easier and more practical to hold than a succession of small mountains. It was no harder to attack up a mountain than on the level, I argued. "That depends on the mountains," he said. "Look at San Gabriele." "Yes," I said, "but where they had trouble was at the top where it was flat. They got up to the top easy enough." "Not so easy," he said. "Yes," I said, "but that was a special case because it was a fortress rather than a mountain, anyway. The Austrians had been fortifying it for years." I meant tactically speaking in a war where there was some movement a succession of mountains were nothing to hold as a line because it was too easy to turn them. You should have possible mobility and a mountain is not very mobile. Also, people always over-shoot down hill. If the flank were turned, the best men would be left on the highest mountains. I did not believe in a war in mountains. I had thought about it a lot, I said. You pinched off one mountain and they pinched off an- other but when something really started every one had to get down off the mountains. What were you going to do if you had a mountain frontier? he asked. I had not worked that out yet, I said, and we both laughed. "But," I said, "in the old days the Austrians were always whipped in the quadrilateral around Ve- A FAREWELL TO ARMS 195 rona. They let them come down onto the plain and whipped them there.' ' "Yes," said Gino. "But those were Frenchmen and you can work out military problems clearly when you are fighting in somebody else's country." "Yes," I agreed, "when it is your own country you cannot use it so scientifically." "The Russians did, to trap Napoleon." "Yes, but they had plenty of country. If you tried to retreat to trap Napoleon in Italy you would find yourself in Brindisi." "A terrible place," said Gino. "Have you ever been there?" "Not to stay." "I am a patriot," Gino said. "But I cannot love Brindisi or Taranto." "Do you love the Bainsizza?" I asked. "The soil is sacred," he said. "But I wish it grew more potatoes. You know when we came here we found fields of potatoes the Austrians had planted." "Has the food really been short?" "I myself have never had enough to eat but I am a big eater and I have not starved. The mess is average. The regiments in the line get pretty good food but those in support don't get so much. Something is wrong somewhere. There should be plenty of food." "The dogfish are selling it somewhere else." "Yes, they give the battalions in the front line as much as they can but the ones in back are very short. They have eaten all the Austrians' potatoes and chest- nuts from the woods. They ought to feed them better. We are big eaters. I am sure there is plenty of food. It is very bad for the soldiers to be short of food 196 A FAREWELL TO ARMS Have you ever noticed the difference it makes in the way you think ?" "Yes," I said. "It can't win a war but it can lose one. "We won't talk about losing. There is enough talk about losing. What has been done this summer cannot have been done in vain." I did not say anything. I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice and the ex- pression in vain. We had heard them, sometimes stand- ing in the rain almost out of earshot, so that only the shouted words came through, and had read them, on proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over other proclamations, now for a long time, and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stock- yards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity. Certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and these with the names of the places were all you could say and have them mean any- thing. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates. Gino was a pa- triot, so he said things that separated us sometimes, but he was also a fine boy and I understood his being a patriot. He was born one. He left with Peduzzi in the car to go back to Gorizia. It stormed all that day. The wind drove down the rain and everywhere there was standing water and mud. The plaster of the broken houses was gray and wet. Late in the afternoon the rain stopped and from A FAREWELL TO ARMS 197 out number two post I saw the bare wet autumn coun- try with clouds over the tops of the hills and the straw screening over the roads wet and dripping. The sun came out once before it went down and shone on the bare woods beyond the ridge. There were many Aus- trian guns in the woods on that ridge but only a few fired. I watched the sudden round puffs of shrapnel smoke in the sky above a broken farmhouse near where the line was ; soft puffs with a yellow white flash in the centre. You saw the flash, then heard the crack, then saw the smoke ball distort and thin in the wind. There were many iron shrapnel balls in the rubble of the houses and on the road beside the broken house where the post was, but they did not shell near the post that afternoon. We loaded two cars and drove down the road that was screened with wet mats and the last of the sun came through in the breaks between the strips of mattings. Before we were out on the clear road be- hind the hill the sun was down. We went on down the clear road and as it turned a corner into the open and went into the square arched tunnel of matting the rain started again. The wind rose in the night and at three o'clock in the morning with the rain coming in sheets there was a bombardment and the Croatians came over across the mountain meadows and through patches of woods and into the front line. They fought in the dark in the rain and a counter-attack of scared men from the second line drove them back. There was much shelling and many rockets in the rain and machine-gun and rifle fire all along the line. They did not come again and it was quieter and between the gusts of wind and rain we could hear the sound of a great bombardment far to the north. 198 A FAREWELL TO ARMS The wounded were coming into the post, some were carried on stretchers, some walking and some were brought on the backs of men that came across the field. They were wet to the skin and all were scared. We filled two cars with stretcher cases as they came up from the cellar of the post and as I shut the door of the sec- ond car and fastened it I felt the rain on my face turn to snow. The flakes were coming heavy and fast in the rain. When daylight came the storm was still blowing but the snow had stopped. It had melted as it fell on the wet ground and now it was raining again. There was another attack just after daylight but it was unsuccess- ful. We expected an attack all day but it did not come until the sun was going down. The bombardment started to the south below the long wooded ridge where the Austrian guns were concentrated. We expected a bombardment but it did not come. It was getting dark. Guns were firing from the field behind the village and the shells, going away, had a comfortable sound. We heard that the attack to the south had been un- successful. They did not attack that night but we heard that they had broken through to the north. In the night word came that we were to prepare to retreat. The cap- tain at the post told me this. He had it from the Bri- gade. A little while later he came from the telephone and said it was a lie. The Brigade had received orders that the line of the Bainsizza should be held no matter what happened. I asked about the break through and he said that he had heard at the Brigade that the Aus- trians had broken through the twenty-seventh army corps up toward Caporetto. There had been a great battle in the north all day. "If those bastards let them through we .are cooked," he said. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 199 "It's Germans that are attacking," one of the medi- cal officers said. The word Germans was something to be frightened of. We did not want to have any- thing to do with the Germans. "There are fifteen divisions of Germans/' the medi- cal officer said. "They have broken through and we will be cut off." "At the Brigade, they say this line is to be held. They say they have not broken through badly and that we will hold a line across the mountains from Monte Mag- giore." "Where do they hear this?" "From the Division." "The word that we were to retreat came from the Division." "We work under the Army Corps," I said. "But here I work under you. Naturally when you tell me to go I will go. But get the orders straight." "The orders are that we stay here. You clear the wounded from here to the clearing station." "Sometimes we clear from the clearing station to the field hospitals too," I said. "Tell me, I have never seen a retreat â€” if there is a retreat how are all the wounded evacuated?" "They are not. They take as many as they can and leave the rest." "What will I take in the cars?" "Hospital equipment." "All right," I said. The next night the retreat started. We heard that Germans and Austrians had broken through in the north and were coming down the mountain valleys to- ward Cividale and Udine. The retreat was orderly, wet and sullen. In the night, going slowly along the crowded roads we passed troops marching under the 200 A FAREWELL TO ARMS rain, guns, horses pulling wagons, mules, motor trucks, all moving away from the front. There was no more disorder than in an advance. That night we helped empty the field hospitals that had been set up in the least ruined villages of the pla- teau, taking the wounded down to Plava on the river- bed: and the next day hauled all day in the rain to evacuate the hospitals and clearing station at Plava. It rained steadily and the army of the Bainsizza moved down off the plateau in the October rain and across the river where the great victories had commenced in the spring of that year. We came into Gorizia in the mid- dle of the next day. The rain had stopped and the town was nearly empty. As we came up the street they were loading the girls from the soldiers' whorehouse into a truck. There were seven girls and they had on their hats and coats and carried small suitcases. Two of them were crying. Of the others one smiled at us and put out her tongue and fluttered it up and down. She had thick full lips and black eyes. I stopped the car and went over and spoke to the ma- tron. The girls from the officers' house had left early that morning, she said. Where were they going? To Conegliano, she said. The truck started. The girl with thick lips put out her tongue again at us. The matron waved. The two girls kept on crying. The others looked interestedly out at the town. I got back in the car. "We ought to go with them," Bonello said. "That would be a good trip." "We'll have a good trip," I said. "We'll have a hell of a trip." "That's what I mean," I said. We came up the drive to the villa. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 201 "I'd like to be there when some of those tough ba- bies climb in and try and hop them. ,, "You think they will?" "Sure. Everybody in the Second Army knows that matron." We were outside the villa. "They call her the Mother Superior," Bonello said. "The girls are new but everybody knows her. They must have brought them up just before the retreat." "They'll have a time." "I'll say they'll have a time. I'd like to have a crack at them for nothing. They charge too much at that house anyway. The government gyps us." "Take the car out and have the mechanics go over it," I said. "Change the oil and check the differential. Fill it up and then get some sleep." "Yes, Signor Tenente." The villa was empty. Rinaldi was gone with the hospital. The major was gone taking hospital person- nel in the staff car. There was a note on the window for me to fill the cars with the material piled in the hall and to proceed to Pordenone. The mechanics were gone already. I went out back to the garage. The other two cars came in while I was there and their driv- ers got down. It was starting to rain again. "I'm so sleepy I went to sleep three times com- ing here from Plava," Piani said. "What are we going to do, Tenente?" "We'll change the oil, grease them, fill them up, then take them around in front and load up the junk they've left." "Then do we start?" "No, we'll sleep for three hours." 202 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Christ I'm glad to sleep/' Bonello said. "I couldn't keep awake driving." "How's your car, Aymo ?" I asked. "It's all right." "Get me a monkey suit and I'll help you with the oil." "Don't you do that, Tenente," Aymo said. "It's nothing to do. You go and pack your things." "My things are all packed," I said. "I'll go and carry out the stuff that they left for us. Bring the cars around as soon as they're ready." They brought the cars around to the front of the villa and we loaded them with the hospital equipment which was piled in the hallway. When it was all in, the three cars stood in line down the driveway under the trees in the rain. We went inside. "Make a fire in the kitchen and dry your things," I said. "I don't care about dry clothes," Piani said. "I want to sleep." "I'm going to sleep on the major's bed," Bonello said. "I'm going to sleep where the old man corks off." "I don't care where I sleep," Piani said. "There are two beds in here." I opened the door. "I never knew what was in that room," Bonello said. "That was old fish-face's room," Piani said. "You two sleep in there," I said. "I'll wake you." "The Austrians will wake us if you sleep too long, Tenente," Bonello said. "I won't oversleep," I said. "Where's Aymo?" "He went out in the kitchen." "Get to sleep," I said. "I'll sleep," Piani said. "I've been asleep sitting up A FAREWELL TO ARMS 203 all day. The whole top of my head kept coming down over my eyes." "Take your boots off," Bonello said. "That's old fish-face's bed." "Fish-face is nothing to me." Piani lay on the bed, his muddy boots straight out, his head on his arm. I went out to the kitchen. Aymo had a fire in the stove and a kettle of water on. "I thought I'd start some pasta asciutta" he said. "We'll be hungry when we wake up." "Aren't you sleepy, Bartolomeo?" "Not so sleepy. When the water boils I'll leave it. The fire will go down." "You'd better get some sleep," I said. "We can eat cheese and monkey meat." "This is better," he said. "Something hot will be good for those two anarchists. You go to sleep, Ten- ente." "There's a bed in the major's room." "You sleep there." "No, I'm going up to my old room. Do you want a drink, Bartolomeo?" "When we go, Tenente. Now it wouldn't do me any good." "If you wake in three hours and I haven't called you, wake me, will you?" "I haven't any watch, Tenente." "There's a clock on the wall in the major's room." "All right" I went out then through the dining-room and the hall and up the marble stairs to the room where I had lived with Rinaldi. It was raining outside. I went to the window and looked out. It was getting dark and I saw the three cars standing in line under the trees. 2o 4 A FAREWELL TO ARMS The trees were dripping in the rain. It was cold and the drops hung to the branches. I went back to Ri- naldi's bed and lay down and let sleep take me. We ate in the kitchen before we started. Aymo had a basin of spaghetti with onions and tinned meat chopped up in it. We sat around the table and drank two bottles of the wine that had been left in the cellar of the villa. It was dark outside and still raining. Piani sat at the table very sleepy. "I like a retreat better than an advance," Bonello said. "On a retreat we drink barbera." "We drink it now. To-morrow maybe we drink rain- water," Aymo said. "To-morrow we'll be in Udine. We'll drink cham- pagne. That's where the slackers live. Wake up, Piani ! We'll drink champagne to-morrow in Udine !" "I'm awake," Piani said. He filled his plate with the spaghetti and meat. "Couldn't you find tomato sauce, Barto?" "There wasn't any," Aymo said. "We'll drink champagne in Udine," Bonello said. He filled his glass with the clear red barbera. "We may drink before Udine," Piani said. "Have you eaten enough, Tenente?" Aymo asked. "I've got plenty. Give me the bottle, Bartolomeo." "I have a bottle apiece to take in the cars," Aymo said. "Did you sleep at all ?" "I don't need much sleep. I slept a little." "To-morrow we'll sleep in the king's bed," Bonello said. He was feeling very good. "To-morrow maybe we'll sleep in ," Piani said. "I'll sleep with the queen," Bonello said. He looked to see how I took the joke. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 205 "You'll sleep with ," Piani said sleepily. "That's treason, Tenente, ,, Bonello said. "Isn't that treason?" "Shut up," I said. "You get too funny with a little wine." Outside it was raining hard. I looked at my watch. It was half -past nine. "It's time to roll," I said and stood up. "Who are you going to ride with, Tenente?" Bo- nello asked. "With Aymo. Then you come. Then Piani. We'll start out on the road for Cormons." "I'm afraid I'll go to sleep," Piani said. "All right. I'll ride with you. Then Bonello. Then Aymo." "That's the best way," Piani said. "Because I'm so sleepy." "I'll drive and you sleep awhile." "No. I can drive just so long as I know somebody will wake me up if I go to sleep." "I'll wake you up. Put out the lights, Barto." "You might as well leave them," Bonello said. "We've got no more use for this place." "I have a small locker trunk in my room," I said. "Will you help take it down, Piani ?" "We'll take it," Piani said. "Come on, Aldo." He went off into the hall with Bonello. I heard them go- ing upstairs. "This was a fine place," Bartolomeo Aymo said. He put two bottles of wine and half a cheese into his haver- sack. "There won't be a place like this again. Where will they retreat to, Tenente?" "Beyond the Tagliamento, they say. The hospital and the sector are to be at Pordenone." 206 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "This is a better town than Pordenone." "I don't know Pordenone/' I said. "I've just been through there." "It's not much of a place/' Aymo said. CHAPTER XXVIII As we moved out through the town it was empty in the rain and the dark except for columns of troops and guns that were going through the main street. There were many trucks too and some carts going through on other streets and converging on the main road. When we were out past the tanneries onto the main road the troops, the motor trucks, the horse-drawn carts and the guns were in one wide slow-moving column. We moved slowly but steadily in the rain, the radiator cap of our car almost against the tailboard of a truck that was loaded high, the load covered with wet canvas. Then the truck stopped. The whole column was stopped. It started again and we went a little farther, then stopped. I got out and walked ahead, going between the trucks and carts and under the wet necks of the horses. The block was farther ahead. I left the road, crossed the ditch on a footboard and walked along the field beyond the ditch. I could see the stalled column between the trees in the rain as I went forward across from it in the field. I went about a mile. The column did not move, although, on the other side beyond the stalled vehicles I could see the troops moving. I went back to the cars. This block might extend as far as Udine. Piani was asleep over the wheel. I climbed up beside him and went to sleep too. Several hours later I heard the truck ahead of us grinding into gear. I woke Piani and we started, moving a few yards, then stopping, then going on again. It was still raining. The column stalled again in the night and did not 207 208 A FAREWELL TO ARMS start. I got down and went back to see Aymo and Bonello. Bonello had two sergeants of engineers on the seat of his car with him. They stiffened when I came up. "They were left to do something to a bridge," Bo- nello said. "They can't find their unit so I gave them a ride." "With the Sir Lieutenant's permission/' "With permission," I said. "The lieutenant is an American," Bonello said. "He'll give anybody a ride." One of the sergeants smiled. The other asked Bo- nello if I was an Italian from North or South America. "He's not an Italian. He's North American Eng- lish." The sergeants were polite but did not believe it. I left them and went back to Aymo. He had two girls on the seat with him and was sitting back in the corner and smoking. "Barto, Barto," I said. He laughed. "Talk to them, Tenente," he said. "I can't understand them. Hey!" he put his hand on the girl's thigh and squeezed it in a friendly way. The girl drew her shawl tight around her and pushed his hand away. "Hey!" he said. "Tell the Tenente your name and what you're doing here." The girl looked at me fiercely. The other girl kept her eyes down. The girl who looked at me said some- thing in a dialect I could not understand a word of. She was plump and dark and looked about sixteen. "Sorella?" I asked and pointed at the other girl. She nodded her head and smiled. "All right," I said and patted her knee. I felt her stiffen away when I touched her. The sister never A FAREWELL TO ARMS 209 looked up. She looked perhaps a year younger. Aymo put his hand on the elder girl's thigh and she pushed it away. He laughed at her. "Good man," he pointed at himself. "Good man," he pointed at me. "Don't you worry." The girl looked at him fiercely. The pair of them were like two wild birds. "What does she ride with me for if she doesn't like me?" Aymo asked. "They got right up in the car the minute I motioned to them." He turned to the girl. "Don't worry," he said. "No danger of ," using the vulgar word. "No place for ." I could see she understood the word and that was all. Her eyes looked at him very scared. She pulled the shawl tight. "Car all full," Aymo said. "No danger of . No place for ." Every time he said the word the girl stif- fened a little. Then sitting stiffly and looking at him she began to cry. I saw her lips working and then tears came down her plump cheeks. Her sister, not looking up, took her hand and they sat there together. The older one, who had been so fierce, began to sob. "I guess I scared her," Aymo said. "I didn't mean to scare her." Bartolomeo brought out his knapsack and cut off two pieces of cheese. "Here," he said. "Stop crying." The older girl shook her head and still cried, but the younger girl took the cheese and commenced to eat. After a while the younger girl gave her sister the sec- ond piece of cheese and they both ate. The older sister still sobbed a little. "She'll be all right after a while," Aymo said. An idea came to him. "Virgin?" he asked the girl next to him. She nodded her head vigorously. "Vir- gin too ?" he pointed to the sister. Both the girls nod- 210 A FAREWELL TO ARMS ded their heads and the elder said something in dialect. "That's all right," Bartolomeo said. "That's all right." Both the girls seemed cheered. I left them sitting together with Aymo sitting back in the corner and went back to Piani's car. The column of vehicles did not move but the troops kept passing alongside. It was still raining hard and I thought some of the stops in the movement of the column might be from cars with wet wiring. More likely they were from horses or men going to sleep. Still, traffic could tie up in cities when every one was awake. It was the combination of horse and motor vehicles. They did not help each other any. The peasants' carts did not help much either. Those were a couple of fine girls with Barto. A retreat was no place for two virgins. Real virgins. Probably very religious. If there were no war we would probably all be in bed. In bed I lay me down my head. Bed and board. Stiff as a board in bed. Catherine was in bed now between two sheets, over her and under her. Which side did she sleep on? Maybe she wasn't asleep. Maybe she was lying think- ing about me. Blow, blow, ye western wind. Well, it blew and it wasn't the small rain but the big rain down that rained. It rained all night. You knew it rained down that rained. Look at it. Christ, that my love were in my arms and I in my bed again. That my love Cath- erine. That my sweet love Catherine down might rain. Blow her again to me. Well, we were in it. Every one was caught in it and the small rain would not quiet it. "Good-night, Catherine/' I said out loud. "I hope you sleep well. If it's too uncomfortable, darling, lie on the other side," I said. "I'll get you some cold water. In a little while it will be morning and then it won't be so A FAREWELL TO ARMS 211 bad. I'm sorry he makes you so uncomfortable. Try and go to sleep, sweet." I was asleep all the time, she said. You've been talk- ing in your sleep. Are you all right ? Are you really there ? Of course I'm here. I wouldn't go way. This doesn't make any difference between us. You're so lovely and sweet. You wouldn't go away in the night, would you ? Of course I wouldn't go away. I'm always here. I come whenever you want me. " ," Piani said. "They've started again." "I was dopey," I said. I looked at my watch. It was three o'clock in the morning. I reached back be- hind the seat for a bottle of the barbera. "You talked out loud," Piani said. "I was having a dream in English," I said. The rain was slacking and we were moving along. Before daylight we were stalled again and when it was light we were at a little rise in the ground and I saw the road of the retreat stretched out far ahead, everything stationary except for the infantry filtering through. We started to move again but seeing the rate of progress in the daylight, I knew we were going to have to get off that main road some way and go across country if we ever hoped to reach Udine. In the night many peasants had joined the column from the roads of the country and in the column there were carts loaded with household goods; there were mirrors projecting up between mattresses, and chickens and ducks tied to carts. There was a sewing-machine on the cart ahead of us in the rain. They had saved the most valuable things. On some carts the women sat 212 A FAREWELL TO ARMS huddled from the rain and others walked beside the carts keeping as close to them as they could. There were dogs now in the column, keeping under the wagons as they moved along. The road was muddy, the ditches at the side were high with water and beyond the trees that lined the road the fields looked too wet and too soggy to try to cross. I got down from the car and worked up the road a way, looking for a place where I could see ahead to find a side-road we could take across country. I knew there were many side-roads but did not want one that would lead to nothing. I could not remember them because we had always passed them bowling along in the car on the main road and they all looked much alike. Now I knew we must find one if we hoped to get through. No one knew where the Austrians were nor how things were going but I was certain that if the rain should stop and planes come over and get to work on that column that it would be all over. All that was needed was for a few men to leave their trucks or a few horses be killed to tie up completely the move- ment on the road. The rain was not falling so heavily now and I thought it might clear. I went ahead along the edge of the road and when there was a small road that led off to the north between two fields with a hedge of trees on both sides, I thought that we had better take it and hurried back to the cars. I told Piani to turn off and went back to tell Bonello and Aymo. "If it leads nowhere we can turn around and cut back in," I said. "What about these?" Bonello asked. His two ser- geants were beside him on the seat. They were un- shaven but still military looking in the early morning. "They'll be good to push," I said. I went back to A FAREWELL TO ARMS 213 Aymo and told him we were going to try it across country. "What about my virgin family ?" Aymo asked. The two girls were asleep. "They won't be very useful," I said. "You ought to have some one that could push." "They could go back in the car," Aymo said. "There's room in the car." "All right if you want them," I said. "Pick up some- body with a wide back to push." "Bersaglieri," Aymo smiled. "They have the widest backs. They measure them. How do you feel, Ten- ente?" "Fine. How are you?" "Fine. But very hungry." "There ought to be something up that road and we will stop and eat." "How's your leg, Tenente?" "Fine," I said. Standing on the step and looking up ahead I could see Piani's car pulling out onto the little side-road and starting up it, his car showing through the hedge of bare branches. Bonello turned off and followed him and then Piani worked his way out and we followed the two ambulances ahead along the nar- row road between hedges. It led to a farmhouse. We found Piani and Bonello stopped in the farmyard. The house was low and long with a trellis with a grape-vine over the door. There was a well in the yard and Piani was getting up water to fill his radiator. So much go- ing in low gear had boiled it out. The farmhouse was deserted. I looked back down the road, the farmhouse was on a slight elevation above the plain, and we could see over the country, and saw the road, the hedges, the fields and the line of trees along the main road where 2i 4 A FAREWELL TO ARMS the retreat was passing. The two sergeants were look- ing through the house. The girls were awake and look- ing at the courtyard, the well and the two big ambu- lances in front of the farmhouse, with three drivers at the well. One of the sergeants came out with a clock in his hand. 'Tut it back," I said. He looked at me, went in the house and came back without the clock. " Where's your partner?" I asked. "He's gone to the latrine." He got up on the seat of the ambulance. He was afraid we would leave him. "What about breakfast, Tenente?" Bonello asked. "We could eat something. It wouldn't take very long." "Do you think this road going down on the other side will lead to anything?" "Sure." "All right. Let's eat." Piani and Bonello went in the house. "Come on," Aymo said to the girls. He held his hand to help them down. The older sister shook her hecid. They were not going into any deserted house. They looked after us. "They are difficult," Aymo said. We went into the farmhouse together. It was large and dark, an aban- doned feeling. Bonello and Piani were in the kitchen. "There's not much to eat," Piani said. "They've cleaned it out." Bonello sliced a big white cheese on the heavy kitchen table. "Where was the cheese?" "In the cellar. Piani found wine too and apples." "That's a good breakfast." Piani was taking the wooden cork out of a big wick- A FAREWELL TO ARMS 215 er-covered wine jug. He tipped it and poured a copper pan full. "It smells all right," he said. "Find some beakers, Barto." The two sergeants came in. "Have some cheese, sergeants," Bonello said. "We should go," one of the sergeants said, eating his cheese and drinking a cup of wine. "We'll go. Don't worry," Bonello said. "An army travels on its stomach," I said. "What?" asked the sergeant. "It's better to eat." "Yes. But time is precious." "I believe the bastards have eaten already," Piani said. The sergeants looked at him. They hated the lot of us. "You know the road?" one of them asked me. "No," I said. They looked at each other. "We would do best to start," the first one said. "We are starting," I said. I drank another cup of the red wine. It tasted very good after the cheese and apple. "Bring the cheese," I said and went out. Bonello came out carrying the great jug of wine. "That's too big," I said. He looked at it regretfully. "I guess it is," he said. "Give me the canteens to fill." He filled the canteens and some of the wine ran out on the stone paving of the courtyard. Then he picked up the wine jug and put it just inside the door. "The Austrians can find it without breaking the door down," he said. "We'll roll," I said. "Piani and I will go ahead." The two engineers were already on the seat beside Bo- nello. The girls were eating cheese and apples. Aymo 216 A FAREWELL TO ARMS was smoking. We started off down the narrow road. I looked back at the two cars coming and the farm- house. It was a fine, low, solid stone house and the ironwork of the well was very good. Ahead of us the road was narrow and muddy and there was a high hedge on either side. Behind, the cars were following closely. CHAPTER XXIX At noon we were stuck in a muddy road about, as nearly as we could figure, ten kilometres from Udine. The rain had stopped during the forenoon and three times we had heard planes coming, seen them pass over- head, watched them go far to the left and heard them bombing on the main highroad. We had worked through a network of secondary roads and had taken many roads that were blind, but had always, by backing up and find- ing another road, gotten closer to Udine. Now, Aymo's car, in backing so that we might get out of a blind road, had gotten into the soft earth at the side and the wheels, spinning, had dug deeper and deeper until the car rested on its differential. The thing to do now was to dig out in front of the wheels, put in brush so that the chains could grip, and then push until the car was on the road. We were all down on the road around the car. The two sergeants looked at the car and examined the wheels. Then they started off down the road without a word. I went after them. "Come on," I said. "Cut some brush." "We have to go," one said. "Get busy," I said, "and cut brush." "We have to go," one said. The other said nothing. They were in a hurry to start. They would not look at me. "I order you to come back to the car and cut brush," I said. The one sergeant turned. "We have to go on. In a little while you will be cut off. You can't order us. You're not our officer." "I order you to cut brush," I said. They turned and started down the road. 217 ai8 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Halt," I said. They kept on down the muddy road, the hedge on either side. "I order you to halt," I called. They went a little faster. I opened up my holster, took the pistol, aimed at the one who had talked the most, and fired. I missed and they both started to run. I shot three times and dropped one. The other went through the hedge and was out of sight. I fired at him through the hedge as he ran across the field. The pistol clicked empty and I put in another clip. I saw it was too far to shoot at the second sergeant. He was far across the field, running, his head held low. I com- menced to reload the empty clip. Bonello came up. "Let me go finish him," he said. I handed him the pistol and he walked down to where the sergeant of engineers lay face down across the road. Bonello leaned over, put the pistol against the man's head and pulled the trigger. The pistol did not fire. "You have to cock it," I said. He cocked it and fired twice. He took hold of the sergeant's legs and pulled him to the side of the road so he lay beside the hedge. He came back and handed me the pistol. "The son of a bitch," he said. He looked toward the sergeant. "You see me shoot him, Tenente?" "We've got to get the brush quickly," I said. "Did I hit the other one at all?" "I don't think so," Aymo said. "He was too far away to hit with a pistol." "The dirty scum," Piani said. We were all cutting twigs and branches. Everything had been taken out of the car. Bonello was digging out in front of the wheels. When we were ready Aymo started the car and put it into gear. The wheels spun round throwing brush and mud. Bonello and I pushed until we could feel our joints crack. The car would not move. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 219 "Rock her back and forth, Barto," I said. He drove the engine in reverse, then forward. The wheels only dug in deeper. Then the car was resting on the differential again, and the wheels spun freely in the holes they had dug. I straightened up. "We'll try her with a rope," I said. "I don't think it's any use, Tenente. You can't get a straight pull. ,, "We have to try it," I said. "She won't come out any other way." Piani's and Bonello's cars could only move straight ahead down the narrow road. We roped both cars to- gether and pulled. The wheels only pulled sideways against the ruts. "It's no good," I shouted. "Stop it." Piani and Bonello got down from their cars and came back. Aymo got down. The girls were up the road about forty yards sitting on a stone wall. "What do you say, Tenente?" Bonello asked. "We'll dig out and try once more with the brush," I said. I looked down the road. It was my fault I had led them up here. The sun was almost out from behind the clouds and the body of the sergeant lay be- side the hedge. "We'll put his coat and cape under," I said. Bonello went to get them. I cut brush and Aymo and Piani dug out in front and between the wheels. I cut the cape, then ripped it in two, and laid it under the wheel in the mud, then piled brush for the wheels to catch. We were ready to start and Aymo got up on the seat and started the car. The wheels spun and we pushed and pushed. But it wasn't any use. "It's ed," I said. "Is there anything you want in the ear, Barto?" 220 A FAREWELL TO ARMS Aymo climbed up with Bonello, carrying the cheese and two bottles of wine and his cape. Bonello, sitting behind the wheel, was looking through the pockets of the sergeant's coat. "Better throw the coat away," I said. "What about Barto's virgins ?" "They can get in the back," Piani said. "I don't think we are going far." I opened the back door of the ambulance. "Come on," I said. "Get in." The two girls climbed in and sat in the corner. They seemed to have taken no notice of the shooting. I looked back up the road. The sergeant lay in his dirty long-sleeved underwear. I got up with Piani and we started. We were going to try to cross the field. When the road entered the field I got down and walked ahead. If we could get across, there was a road on the other side. We could not get across. It was too soft and muddy for the cars. When they were finally and completely stalled, the wheels dug in to the hubs, we left them in the field and started on foot for Udine. When we came to the road which led back toward the main highway I pointed down it to the two girls. "Go down there," I said. "You'll meet people." They looked at me. I took out my pocket-book and gave them each a ten-lira note. "Go down there," I said, pointing. "Friends! Family!" They did not understand but they held the money tightly and started down the road. They looked back as though they were afraid I might take the money back. I watched them go down the road, their shawls close around them, looking back apprehensively at us. The three drivers were laughing. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 221 "How much will you give me to go in that direction, Tenente?" Bonello asked. "They're better off in a bunch of people than alone if they catch them/' I said. "Give me two hundred lire and I'll walk straight back toward Austria," Bonello said. "They'd take it away from you," Piani said. "Maybe the war will be over," Aymo said. We were going up the road as fast as we could. The sun was trying to come through. Beside the road were mul- berry trees. Through the trees I could see our two big moving-vans of cars stuck in the field. Piani looked back too. "They'll have to build a road to get them out," he said. "I wish to Christ we had bicycles," Bonello said. "Do they ride bicycles in America?" Aymo asked. "They used to." "Here it is a great thing," Aymo said. "A bicycle is a splendid thing." "I wish to Christ we had bicycles," Bonello said. "I'm no walker." "Is that firing?" I asked. I thought I could hear firing a long way away. "I don't know," Aymo said. He listened. "I think so," I said. "The first thing we will see will be the cavalry," Piani said. "I don't think they've got any cavalry." "I hope to Christ not," Bonello said. "I don't want to be stuck on a lance by any cavalry." "You certainly shot that sergeant, Tenente," Piani said. We were walking fast. "I killed him," Bonello said. "I never killed anybody 222 A FAREWELL TO ARMS in this war, and all my life I've wanted to kill a ser- geant." "You killed him on the sit all right," Piani said. "He wasn't flying very fast when you killed him." "Never mind. That's one thing I can always remem- ber. I killed that of a sergeant." "What will you say in confession?" Aymo asked. "I'll say, 'Bless me, father, I killed a sergeant/ " They all laughed. "He's an anarchist," Piani said. "He doesn't go to church." "Piani's an anarchist too," Bonello said. "Are you really anarchists?" I asked. "No, Tenente. We're socialists. We come from Imola." "Haven't you ever been there?" "No." "By Christ it's a fine place, Tenente. You come there after the war and we'll show you something." "Are you all socialists?" "Everybody." "Is it a fine town?" "Wonderful. You never saw a town like that." "How did you get to be socialists?" "We're all socialists. Everybody is a socialist. We've always been socialists." "You come, Tenente. We'll make you a socialist too." Ahead the road turned off to the left and there was a little hill and, beyond a stone wall, an apple orchard. As the road went uphill they ceased talking. We walked along together all going fast against time. CHAPTER XXX Later we were on a road that led to a river. There was a long line of abandoned trucks and carts on the road leading up to the bridge. No one was in sight. The river was high and the bridge had been blown up in the centre; the stone arch was fallen into the river and the brown water was going over it. We went on up the bank looking for a place to cross. Up ahead I knew there was a railway bridge and I thought we might be able to get across there. The path was wet and muddy. We did not see any troops; only aban- doned trucks and stores. Along the river bank there was nothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy ground. We went up to the bank and finally we saw the railway bridge. "What a beautiful bridge/' Aymo said. It was a long plain iron bridge across what was usually a dry river-bed. "We better hurry and get across before they blow it up," I said. "There's nobody to blow it up," Piani said. "They're all gone." "It's probably mined," Bonello said. "You cross first, Tenente." "Listen to the anarchist," Aymo said. "Make him go first." "HI go," I said. "It won't be mined to blow up with one man." "You see," Piani said. "That is brains. Why haven't you brains, anarchist?" 223 224 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "If I had brains I wouldn't be here," Bonello said. "That's pretty good, Tenente," Aymo said. "That's pretty good," I said. We were close to the bridge now. The sky had clouded over again and it was raining a little. The bridge looked long and solid. We climbed up the embankment. "Come one at a time," I said and started across the bridge. I watched the ties and the rails for any trip- wires or signs of explosive but I saw nothing. Down below the gaps in the ties the river ran muddy and fast. Ahead across the wet countryside I could see Udine in the rain. Across the bridge I looked back. Just up the river was another bridge. As I watched, a yellow mud- colored motor car crossed it. The sides of the bridge were high and the body of the car, once on, was out of sight. But I saw the heads of the driver, the man on the seat with him, and the two men on the rear seat. They all wore German helmets. Then the car was over the bridge and out of sight behind the trees and the abandoned vehicles on the road. I waved to Aymo who was crossing and to the others to come on. I climbed down and crouched beside the railway embank- ment. Aymo came down with me. "Did you see the car?" I asked. "No. We were watching you." "A German staff car crossed on the upper bridge." "A staff car?" "Yes." "Holy Mary." The others came and we all crouched in the mud be- hind the embankment, looking across the rails at the bridge, the line of trees, the ditch and the road. "Do you think we're cut off then, Tenente?" "I don't know. All I know is a German staff car went along that road." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 225 "You don't feel funny, Tenente? You haven't got strange feelings in the head?" "Don't be funny, Bonello. ,, "What about a drink ?" Piani asked. "If we're cut off we might as well have a drink." He unhooked his canteen and uncorked it. "Look! Look!" Aymo said and pointed toward the road. Along the top of the stone bridge we could see German helmets moving. They were bent forward and moved smoothly, almost supernaturally, along. As they came off the bridge we saw them. They were bicycle troops. I saw the faces of the first two. They were ruddy and healthy-looking. Their helmets came low down over their foreheads and the side of their faces. Their carbines were clipped to the frame of the bicycles. Stick bombs hung handle down from their belts. Their helmets and their gray uniforms were wet and they rode easily, looking ahead and to both sides. There were two â€” then four in line, then two, then al- most a dozen; then another dozen â€” then one alone. They did not talk but we could not have heard them because of the noise from the river. They were gone out of sight up the road. "Holy Mary," Aymo said. "They were Germans," Piani said. "Those weren't Austrians." "Why isn't there somebody here to stop them?" I said. "Why haven't they blown the bridge up? Why aren't there machine-guns along this embankment?" "You tell us, Tenente," Bonello said. I was very angry. "The whole bloody thing is crazy. Down below they blow up a little bridge. Here they leave a bridge on the main road. Where is everybody? Don't they try and stop them at all?" 226 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "You tell us, Tenente," Bonello said. I shut up. It was none of my business ; all I had to do was to get to Pordenone with three ambulances. I had failed at that. All I had to do now was get to Pordenone. I prob- ably could not even get to Udine. The hell I couldn't. The thing to do was to be calm and not get shot or captured. "Didn't you have a canteen open?" I asked Piani. He handed it to me. I took a long drink. "We might as well start," I said. "There's no hurry though. Do you want to eat something?" "This is no place to stay," Bonello said. "All right. We'll start." "Should we keep on this side â€” out of sight?" "We'll be better off on top. They may come along this bridge too. We don't want them on top of us before we see them." We walked along the railroad track. On both sides of us stretched the wet plain. Ahead across the plain was the hill of Udine. The roofs fell away from the castle on the hill. We could see the campanile and the clock-tower. There were many mulberry trees in the fields. Ahead I saw a place where the rails were torn up. The ties had been dug out too and thrown down the embankment. "Down! down!" Aymo said. We dropped down be- side the embankment. There was another group of bicyclists passing along the road. I looked over the edge and saw them go on. "They saw us but they went on," Aymo said. "We'll get killed up there, Tenente," Bonello said. "They don't want us," I said. "They're after some- thing else. We're in more danger if they should come on us suddenly." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 227 "I'd rather walk here out of sight," Bonello said. "All right. We'll walk along the tracks." "Do you think we can get through?" Aymo asked. "Sure. There aren't very many of them yet. We'll go through in the dark." "What was that staff car doing?" "Christ knows," I said. We kept on up the tracks. Bonello tired of walking in the mud of the embank- ment and came up with the rest of us. The railway moved south away from the highway now and we could not see what passed along the road. A short bridge over a canal was blown up but we climbed across on what was left of the span. We heard firing ahead of us. We came up on the railway beyond the canal. It went on straight toward the town across the low fields. We could see the line of the other railway ahead of us. To the north was the main road where we had seen the cyclists; to the south there was a small branch-road across the fields with thick trees on each side. I thought we had better cut to the south and work around the town that w r ay and across country toward Campoformio and the main road to the Tagliamento. We could avoid the main line of the retreat by keeping to the secondary roads beyond Udine. I knew there were plenty of side-roads across the plain. I started down the embankment. "Come on," I said. We would make for the side- road and work to the south of the town. We all started down the embankment. A shot was fired at us from the side-road. The bullet went into the mud of the em- bankment. "Go on back," I shouted. I started up the embank- ment, slipping in the mud. The drivers were ahead of 228 A FAREWELL TO ARMS me. I went up the embankment as fast as I could go. Two more shots came from the thick brush and Aymo, as he was crossing the tracks, lurched, tripped and fell face down. We pulled him down on the other side and turned him over. "His head ought to be uphill/' I said. Piani moved him around. He lay in the mud on the side of the embankment, his feet pointing down- hill, breathing blood irregularly. The three of us squatted over him in the rain. He was hit low in the back of the neck and the bullet had ranged upward and come out under the right eye. He died while I was stopping up the two holes. Piani laid his head down, wiped at his face, with a piece of the emergency dress- ing, then let it alone. "The ," he said. "They weren't Germans," I said. "There can't be any Germans over there." "Italians," Piani said, using the word as an epithet, "Italiani!" Bonello said nothing. He was sitting be- side Aymo, not looking at him. Piani picked up Aymo's cap where it had rolled down the embankment and put it over his face. He took out his canteen. "Do you want a drink?" Piani handed Bonello the canteen. "No," Bonello said. He turned to me. "That might have happened to us any time on the railway tracks." "No," I said. "It was because we started across the field." Bonello shook his head. "Aymo's dead," he said. "Who's dead next, Tenente? Where do we go now?" "Those were Italians that shot," I said. "They weren't Germans." "I suppose if they were Germans they'd have killed all of us," Bonello said. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 229 "We are in more danger from Italians than Ger- mans/' I said. "The rear guard are afraid of every- thing. The Germans know what they're after." "You reason it out, Tenente," Bonello said. "Where do we go now?" Piani asked. "We better lie up some place till it's dark. If we could get south we'd be all right." "They'd have to shoot us all to prove they were right the first time," Bonello said. "I'm not going to try them." "We'll find a place to lie up as near to Udine as we can get and then go through when it's dark." "Let's go then," Bonello said. We went down the north side of the embankment I looked back. Ay mo lay in the mud with the angle of the embankment. He was quite small and his arms were by his side, his puttee-wrapped legs and muddy boots together, his cap over his face. He looked very dead. It was raining. I had liked him as well as any one I ever knew. I had his papers in my pocket and would write to his family. Ahead across the fields was a farmhouse. There were trees around it and the farm buildings were built against the house. There was a balcony along the sec- ond floor held up by columns. "We better keep a little way apart," I said. "I'll go ahead." I started toward the farmhouse. There was a path across the field. Crossing the field, I did not know but that some one would fire on us from the trees near the farmhouse or from the farmhouse itself. I walked toward it, seeing it very clearly. The balcony of the second floor merged into the barn and there was hay coming out between the columns. The courtyard was of stone blocks and all the trees were dripping with the rain. There was a 230 A FAREWELL TO ARMS big empty two- wheeled cart, the shafts tipped high up in the rain. I came to the courtyard, crossed it, and stood under the shelter of the balcony. The door of the house was open and I went in. Bonello and Piani came in after me. It was dark inside. I went back to the kitchen. There were ashes of a fire on the big open hearth. The pots hung over the ashes, but they were empty. I looked around but I could not find anything to eat. "We ought to lie up in the barn," I said. "Do you think you could find anything to eat, Piani, and bring it up there ?" 'Til look," Piani said. 'Til look too," Bonello said. "All right, ,, I said. 'Til go up and look at the barn." I found a stone stairway that went up from the stable underneath. The stable smelt dry and pleas- ant in the rain. The cattle were all gone, probably driven off when they left. The barn was half full of hay. There were two windows in the roof, one was blocked with boards, the other was a narrow dormer window on the north side. There was a chute so that hay might be pitched down to the cattle. Beams crossed the opening down into the main floor where the hay- carts drove in when the hay was hauled in to be pitched up. I heard the rain on the roof and smelled the hay and, when I went down, the clean smell of dried dung in the stable. We could pry a board loose and see out of the south window down into the courtyard. The other window looked out on the field toward the north. We could get out of either window onto the roof and down, or go down the hay chute if the stairs were im- practical. It was a big barn and we could hide in the hay if we heard any one. It seemed like a good place. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 231 I was sure we could have gotten through to the south if they had not fired on us. It was impossible that there were Germans there. They were coming from the north and down the road from Cividale. They could not have come through from the south. The Italians were even more dangerous. They were frightened and firing on anything they saw. Last night on the retreat we had heard that there had been many Germans in Italian uniforms mixing with the retreat in the north. I did not believe it. That was one of those things you always heard in the war. It was one of the things the enemy always did to you. You did not know any one who went over in German uniform to confuse them. Maybe they did but it sounded difficult. I did not believe the Germans did it. I did not believe they had to. There was no need to confuse our retreat. The size of the army and the fewness of the roads did that. Nobody gave any orders, let alone Germans. Still, they would shoot us for Germans. They shot Aymo. The hay smelled good and lying in a barn in the hay took away all the years in between. We had lain in hay and talked and shot sparrows with an air-rifle when they perched in the triangle cut high up in the wall of the barn. The barn was gone now and one year they had cut the hemlock woods and there were only stumps, dried tree-tops, branches and fireweed where the woods had been. You could not go back. If you did not go forward what happened ? You never got back to Milan. And if you got back to Milan what happened? I listened to the firing to the north toward Udine. I could hear machine-gun firing. There was no shelling. That was something. They must have gotten some troops along the road. I looked down in the half-light of the hay-barn and saw Piani standing on the hauling 232 A FAREWELL TO ARMS floor. He had a long sausage, a jar of something and two bottles of wine under his arm. "Come up," I said. "There is the ladder." Then I realized that I should help him with the things and went down. I was vague in the head from lying in the hay. I had been nearly asleep. "Where's Bonello?" I asked. "I'll tell you," Piani said. We went up the ladder. Up on the hay we set the things down. Piani took out his knife with the corkscrew and drew the cork on a wine bottle. "They have sealing-wax on it," he said. "It must be good." He smiled. "Where's Bonello?" I asked. Piani looked at me. "He went away, Tenente," he said. "He wanted to be a prisoner." I did not say anything. "He was afraid we would get killed." I held the bottle of wine and did not say anything. "You see we don't believe in the war anyway, Ten- ente." "Why didn't you go?" I asked. "I did not want to leave you." "Where did he go?" "I don't know, Tenente. He went away." "All right," I said. "Will you cut the sausage?" Piani looked at me in the half-light. "I cut it while we were talking," he said. We sat in the hay and ate the sausage and drank the wine. It must have been wine they had saved for a wedding. It was so old that it was losing its color. "You look out of this window, Luigi," I said. "I'll go look out the other window." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 233 We had each been drinking out of one of the bottles and I took my bottle with me and went over and lay- flat on the hay and looked out the narrow window at the wet country. I do not know what I expected to see but I did not see anything except the fields and the bare mulberry trees and the rain falling. I drank the wine and it did not make me feel good. They had kept it too long and it had gone to pieces and lost its quality and color. I watched it get dark outside ; the darkness came very quickly. It would be a black night with the rain. When it was dark there was no use watching any more, so I went over to Piani. He was lying asleep and I did not wake him but sat down beside him for a while. He was a big man and he slept heavily. After a while I woke him and we started. That was a very strange night. I do not know what I had expected, death perhaps and shooting in the dark and running, but nothing happened. We waited, lying flat beyond the ditch along the main road while a Ger- man battalion passed, then when they were gone we crossed the road and went on to the north. We were very close to Germans twice in the rain but they did not see us. We got past the town to the north without seeing any Italians, then after a while came on the main channels of the retreat and walked all night toward the Tagliamento. I had not realized how gigan- tic the retreat was. The whole country was moving, as well as the army. We walked all night, making better time than the vehicles. My leg ached and I was tired but we made good time. It seemed so silly for Bonello to have decided to be taken prisoner. There was no danger. We had walked through two armies without incident. If Aymo had not been killed there would never have seemed to be any danger. No one had 234 A FAREWELL TO ARMS bothered us when we were in plain sight along the rail- way. The killing came suddenly and unreasonably. I wondered where Bonello was. "How do you feel, Tenente? ,, Piani asked. We were going along the side of a road crowded with vehicles and troops. "Fine." "I'm tired of this walking/' "Well, all we have to do is walk now. We don't have to worry." "Bonello was a fool." "He was a fool all right." "What will you do about him, Tenente?" "I don't know." "Can't you just put him down as taken prisoner?" "I don't know." "You see if the war went on they would make bad trouble for his family." "The war won't go on," a soldier said. "We're going home. The war is over." "Everybody's going home." "We're all going home." "Come on, Tenente," Piani said. He wanted to get past them. "Tenente? Who's a Tenente? A basso gli ufficiali! Down with the officers !" Piani took me by the arm. "I better call you by your name," he said. "They might try and make trouble. They've shot some officers." We worked up past them. "I won't make a report that will make trouble for his family." I went on with our conversation. "If the war is over it makes no difference," Piani said. "But I don't believe it's over. It's too good that it should be over." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 235 "We'll know pretty soon," I said. "I don't believe it's over. They all think it's over but I don't believe it." "Viva la Pace!" a soldier shouted out. "We're go- ing home !" "It would be fine if we all went home," Piani said. "Wouldn't you like to go home?" "Yes." "We'll never go. I don't think it's over." "Andiamo a casa!" a soldier shouted. "They throw away their rifles," Piani said. "They take them off and drop them down while they're marching. Then they shout." "They ought to keep their rifles." "They think if they throw away their rifles they can't make them fight." In the dark and the rain, making our way along the side of the road I could see that many of the troops still had their rifles. They stuck up above the capes. "What brigade are you?" an officer called out. "Brigata di Pace" some one shouted. "Peace Bri- gade!" The officer said nothing. "What does he say? What does the officer say?" "Down with the officer. Viva la Pace!" "Come on," Piani said. We passed two British am- bulances, abandoned in the block of vehicles. "They're from Gorizia," Piani said. "I know the cars." "They got further than we did." "They started earlier." "I wonder where the drivers are?" "Up ahead probably." "The Germans have stopped outside Udine," I said. "These people will all get across the river." 236 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Yes," Piani said. "That's why I think the war will go on." "The Germans could come on," I said. "I wonder why they don't come on." "I don't know. I don't know anything about this kind of war." "They have to wait for their transport I suppose." "I don't know," Piani said. Alone he was much gentler. When he was with the others he was a very rough talker. "Are you married, Luigi?" "You know I am married." "Is that why you did not want to be a prisoner?" "That is one reason. Are you married, Tenente?" "No." "Neither is Bonello." "You can't tell anything by a man's being married. But I should think a married man would want to get back to his wife," I said. I would be glad to talk about wives. "Yes." "How are your feet?" "They're sore enough." Before daylight we reached the bank of the Taglia- mento and followed down along the flooded river to the bridge where all the traffic was crossing. "They ought to be able to hold at this river," Piani said. In the dark the flood looked high. The water swirled and it was wide. The wooden bridge was nearly three-quarters of a mile across, and the river, that usually ran in narrow channels in the wide stony bed far below the bridge, was close under the wooden planking. We went along the bank and then worked A FAREWELL TO ARMS 237 our way into the crowd that were crossing the bridge. Crossing slowly in the rain a few feet above the flood, pressed tight in the crowd, the box of an artillery caisson just ahead, I looked over the side and watched the river. Now that we could not go our own pace I felt very tired. There was no exhilaration in crossing the bridge. I wondered what it would be like if a plane bombed it in the daytime. "Piani," I said. "Here I am, Tenente." He was a little ahead in the jam. No one was talking. They were all trying to get across as soon as they could: thinking only of that. We were almost across. At the far end of the bridge there were officers and carabinieri standing on both sides flashing lights. I saw them silhouetted against the sky-line. As we came close to them I saw one of the officers point to a man in the column. A carabiniere went in after him and came out holding the man by the arm. He took him away from the road. We came almost opposite them. The officers were scrutinizing every one in the column, sometimes speaking to each other, going forward to flash a light in some one's face. They took some one else out just before we came opposite. I saw the man. He was a lieutenant-colo- nel. I saw the stars in the box on his sleeve as they flashed a light on him. His hair was gray and he was short and fat. The carabiniere pulled him in behind the line of officers. As we came opposite I saw one or two of them look at me. Then one pointed at me and spoke to a carabiniere. I saw the carabiniere start for me, come through the edge of the column toward me, then felt him take me by the collar. "What's the matter with you?" I said and hit him in the face. I saw his face under the hat, upturned mus- 238 A FAREWELL TO ARMS taches and blood coming down his cheek. Another one dove in toward us. " What's the matter with you?" I said. He did not answer. He was watching a chance to grab me. I put my arm behind me to loosen my pistol. "Don't you know you can't touch an officer?" The other one grabbed me from behind and pulled my arm up so that it twisted in the socket. I turned with him and the other one grabbed me around the neck. I kicked his shins and got my left knee into his groin. "Shoot him if he resists," I heard some one say. "What's the meaning of this ?" I tried to shout but my voice was not very loud. They had me at the side of the road now. "Shoot him if he resists," an officer said. "Take him over back." "Who are you?" "You'll find out." "Who are you?" "Battle police," another officer said. "Why don't you ask me to step over instead of hav- ing one of these airplanes grab me?" They did not answer. They did not have to answer. They were battle police. "Take him back there with the others," the first officer said. "You see. He speaks Italian with an ac- cent." "So do you, you ," I said. "Take him back with the others," the first officer said. They took me down behind the line of officers below the road toward a group of people in a field by the river bank. As we walked toward them shots were fired. I saw flashes of the rifles and heard the reports. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 239 We came up to the group. There were four officers standing together, with a man in front of them with a carabiniere on each side of him. A group of men were standing guarded by carabinieri. Four other carabin- ieri stood near the questioning officers, leaning on their carbines. They were wide-hatted carabinieri. The two who had me shoved me in with the group waiting to be questioned. I looked at the man the officers were questioning. He was the fat gray-haired little lieuten- ant-colonel they had taken out of the column. The questioners had all the efficiency, coldness and com- mand of themselves of Italians who are firing and are not being fired on. "Your brigade ?" He told them. "Regiment?" He told them. "Why are you not with your regiment?" He told them. "Do you not know that an officer should be with his troops?" He did. That was all. Another officer spoke. "It is you and such as you that have let the barba- rians onto the sacred soil of the fatherland." "I beg your pardon," said the lieutenant-colonel. "It is because of treachery such as yours that we have lost the fruits of victory." "Have you ever been in a retreat?" the lieutenant- colonel asked. "Italy should never retreat." We stood there in the rain and listened to this. We were facing the officers and the prisoner stood in front and a little to one side of us. 2 4 o A FAREWELL TO ARMS "If you are going to shoot me," the lieutenant-colo- nel said, "please shoot me at once without further questioning. The questioning is stupid." He made the sign of the cross. The officers spoke together. One wrote something on a pad of paper. "Abandoned his troops, ordered to be shot," he said. Two carabinieri took the lieutenant-colonel to the river bank. He walked in the rain, an old man with his hat off, a carabiniere on either side. I did not watch them shoot him but I heard the shots. They were questioning some one else. This officer too was separated from his troops. He was not allowed to make an explanation. He cried when they read the sentence from the pad of paper, and they were questioning an- other when they shot him. They made a point of being intent on questioning the next man while the man who had been questioned before was being shot. In this way there was obviously nothing they could do about it. I did not know whether I should wait to be questioned or make a break now. I was obviously a German in Italian uniform. I saw how their minds worked; if they had minds and if they worked. They were all young men and they were saving their country. The second army was being re-formed beyond the Tagliamento. They were executing officers of the rank of major and above who were separated from their troops. They were also dealing summarily with German agitators in Italian uni- form. They wore steel helmets. Only two of us had steel helmets. Some of the carabinieri had them. The other carabinieri wore the wide hat. Airplanes we called them. We stood in the rain and were taken out one at a time to be questioned and shot. So far they had shot every one they had questioned. The questioners had that beautiful detachment and devotion to stern justice A FAREWELL TO ARMS 241 of men dealing in death without being in any danger of it. They were questioning a full colonel of a line regiment. Three more officers had just been put in with us. " Where was his regiment ?" I looked at the carabinieri. They were looking at the newcomers. The others were looking at the colonel. I ducked down, pushed between two men, and ran for the river, my head down. I tripped at the edge and went in with a splash. The water was very cold and I stayed under as long as I could. I could feel the cur- rent swirl me and I stayed under until I thought I could never come up. The minute I came up I took a breath and went down again. It was easy to stay under with so much clothing and my boots. When I came up the second time I saw a piece of timber ahead of me and reached it and held on with one hand. I kept my head behind it and did not even look over it. I did not want to see the bank. There were shots when I ran and shots when I came up the first time. I heard them when I was almost above water. There were no shots now. The piece of timber swung in the current and I held it with one hand. I looked at the bank. It seemed to be going by very fast. There was much wood in the stream. The water was very cold. We passed the brush of an island above the water. I held onto the timber with both hands and let it take me along. The shore was out of sight now. / CHAPTER XXXI You do not know how long you are in a river when the current moves swiftly. It seems a long time and it may be very short. The water was cold and in flood and many things passed that had been floated off the banks when the river rose. I was lucky to have a heavy timber to hold on to, and I lay in the icy water with my chin on the wood, holding as easily as I could with both hands. I was afraid of cramps and I hoped we would move toward the shore. We went down the river in a long curve. It was beginning to be light enough so I could see the bushes along the shore-line. There was a brush island ahead and the current moved toward the shore. I wondered if I should take off my boots and clothes and try to swim ashore, but decided not to. I had never thought of anything but that I would reach the shore some way, and I would be in a bad position if I landed barefoot. I had to get to Mestre some way. I watched the shore come close, then swing away, then come closer again. We were floating more slowly. The shore was very close now. I could see twigs on the willow bush. The timber swung slowly so that the bank was behind me and I knew we were in an eddy. We went slowly around. As I saw the bank again, very close now, I tried holding with one arm and kicking and swimming the timber toward the bank with the other, but I did not bring it any closer. I was afraid we would move out of the eddy and, holding with one hand, I drew up my feet so they were against the side of the timber and shoved hard toward the bank. I 242 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 243 could see the brush, but even with my momentum and swimming as hard as I could, the current was taking me away. I thought then I would drown because of my boots, but I thrashed and fought through the water, and when I looked up the bank was coming toward me, and I kept thrashing and swimming in a heavy-footed panic until I reached it. I hung to the willow branch and did not have strength to pull myself up but I knew I would not drown now. It had never occurred to me on the timber that I might drown. I felt hollow and sick in my stomach and chest from the effort, and I held to the branches and waited. When the sick feeling was gone I pulled into the willow bushes and rested again, my arms around some brush, holding tight with my hands to the branches. Then I crawled out, pushed on through the willows and onto the bank. It was half- daylight and I saw no one. I lay flat on the bank and heard the river and the rain. After a while I got up and started along the bank. I knew there was no bridge across the river until Lati- sana. I thought I might be opposite San Vito. I be- gan to think out what I should do. Ahead there was a ditch running into the river. I went toward it. So far I had seen no one and I sat down by some bushes along the bank of the ditch and took off my shoes and emp- tied them of water. I took off my coat, took my wallet with my papers and my money all wet in it out of the inside pocket and then wrung the coat out. I took off my trousers and wrung them too, then my shirt and underclothing. I slapped and rubbed myself and then dressed again. I had lost my cap. Before I put on my coat I cut the cloth stars off my sleeves and put them in the inside pocket with my money. My money was wet but was all right. I count- 244 A FAREWELL TO ARMS ed it. There were three thousand and some lire. My clothes felt wet and clammy and I slapped my arms to keep the circulation going. I had woven underwear and I did not think I would catch cold if I kept moving. They had taken my pistol at the road and I put the holster under my coat. I had no cape and it was cold in the rain. I started up the bank of the canal. It was daylight and the country was wet, low and dismal look- ing. The fields were bare and wet; a long way away I could see a campanile rising out of the plain. I came up onto a road. Ahead I saw some troops coming down the road. I limped along the side of the road and they passed me and paid no attention to me. They were a machine-gun detachment going up toward the river. I went on down the road. That day I crossed the Venetian plain. It is a low level country and under the rain it is even flatter. To- ward the sea there are salt marshes and very few roads. The roads all go along the river mouths to the sea and to cross the country you must go along the paths beside the canals. I was working across the country from the north to the south and had crossed two railway lines and many roads and finally I came out at the end of a path onto a railway line where it ran beside a marsh. It was the main line from Venice to Trieste, with a high solid embankment, a solid roadbed and double track. Down the tracks a way was a flag-station and I could see soldiers on guard. Up the line there was a bridge over a stream that flowed into the marsh. I could see a guard too at the bridge. Crossing the fields to the north I had seen a train pass on this railroad, visible a long way across the flat plain, and I thought a train might come from Portogruaro. I watched the guards and lay down on the embankment so that I A FAREWELL TO ARMS 245 could see both ways along the track. The guard at the bridge walked a way up the line toward where I lay, then turned and went back toward the bridge. I lay, and was hungry, and waited for the train. The one I had seen was so long that the engine moved it very slowly and I was sure I could get aboard it. After I had almost given up hoping for one I saw a train com- ing. The engine, coming straight on, grew larger slowly. I looked at the guard at the bridge. He was walking on the near side of the bridge but on the other side of the tracks. That would put him out of sight when the train passed. I watched the engine come nearer. It was working hard. I could see there were many cars. I knew there would be guards on the train, and I tried to see where they were, but, keeping out of sight, I could not. The engine was almost to where I was lying. When it came opposite, working and puffing even on the level, and I saw the engineer pass, I stood up and stepped up close to the passing cars. If the guards were watching I was a less suspicious object standing beside the track. Several closed freight-cars passed. Then I saw a low open car of the sort they call gondolas coming, covered with canvas. I stood until it had al- most passed, then jumped and caught the rear hand- rods and pulled up. I crawled down between the gon- dola and the shelter of the high freight-car behind. I did not think any one had seen me. I was holding to the hand-rods and crouching low, my feet on the coup- ling. We were almost opposite the bridge. I remem- bered the guard. As we passed him he looked at me. He was a boy and his helmet was too big for him. I stared at him contemptuously and he looked away. He thought I had something to do with the train. We were past. I saw him still looking uncomfort- 246 A FAREWELL TO ARMS able, watching the other cars pass and I stooped to see how the canvas was fastened. It had grummets and was laced down at the edge with cord. I took out my knife, cut the cord and put my arm under. There were hard bulges under the canvas that tightened in the rain. I looked up and ahead. There was a guard on the freight-car ahead but he was looking forward. I let go of the hand-rails and ducked under the canvas. My forehead hit something that gave me a violent bump and I felt blood on my face but I crawled on in and lay flat. Then I turned around and fastened down the can- vas. I was in under the canvas with guns. They smelled cleanly of oil and grease. I lay and listened to the rain on the canvas and the clicking of the car over the rails. There was a little light came through and I lay and looked at the guns. They had their canvas jackets on. I thought they must have been sent ahead from the third army. The bump on my forehead was swollen and I stopped the bleeding by lying still and letting it coagulate, then picked away the dried blood except over the cut. It was nothing. I had no handkerchief, but feeling with my fingers I washed away where the dried blood had been, with rain-water that dripped from the canvas, and wiped it clean with the sleeve of my coat. I did not want to look conspicuous. I knew I would have to get out before they got to Mestre because they would be taking care of these guns. They had no guns to lose or forget about. I was terrifically hungry. CHAPTER XXXII Lying on the floor of the flat-car with the guns be- side me under the canvas I was wet, cold and very hun- gry. Finally I rolled over and lay flat on my stomach with my head on my arms. My knee was stiff, but it had been very satisfactory. Valentini had done a fine job. I had done half the retreat on foot and swum part of the Tagliamento with his knee. It was his knee all right. The other knee was mine. Doctors did things to you and then it was not your body any more. The head was mine, and the inside of the belly. It was very hungry in there. I could feel it turn over on itself. The head was mine, but not to use, not to think with ; only to remember and not too much remember. I could remember Catherine but I knew I would get crazy if I thought about her when I was not sure yet I would see her, so I would not think about her, only about her a little, only about her with the car going slowly and clickingly, and some light through the can- vas and my lying with Catherine on the floor of the car. Hard as the floor of the car to lie not thinking only feeling, having been away too long, the clothes wet and the floor moving only a little each time and lonesome inside and alone with wet clothing and hard floor for a wife. You did not love the floor of a flat-car nor guns with canvas jackets and the smell of vaselined metal or a canvas that rain leaked through, although it is very fine under a canvas and pleasant with guns; but you loved some one else whom now you knew was not even to be pretended there ; you seeing now very clearly and 247 248 A FAREWELL TO ARMS coldly â€” not so coldly as clearly and emptily. You saw- emptily, lying on your stomach, having been present when one army moved back and another came forward. You had lost your cars and your men as a floorwalker loses the stock of his department in a fire. There was, however, no insurance. You were out of it now. You had no more obligation. If they shot floorwalkers af- ter a fire in the department store because they spoke with an accent they had always had, then certainly the floorwalkers would not be expected to return when the store opened again for business. They might seek other employment; if there was any other employment and the police did not get them. Anger was washed away in the river along with any obligation. Although that ceased when the carabiniere put his hands on my collar. I would like to have had the uniform off although I did not care much about the outward forms. I had taken off the stars, but that was for convenience. It was no point of honor. I was not against them. I was through. I wished them all the luck. There were the good ones, and the brave ones, and the calm ones and the sensible ones, and they deserved it. But it was not my show any more and I wished this bloody train would get to Mestre and I would eat and stop thinking. I would have to stop. Piani would tell them they had shot me. They went through the pockets and took the papers of the people they shot. They would not have my papers. They might call me drowned. I wondered what they would hear in the States. Dead from wounds and other causes. Good Christ I was hungry. I wondered what had become of the priest at the mess. And Rinaldi. He was probably atPordenone. If they had not gone further back. Well, I would never see him now. I would never see any of A FAREWELL TO ARMS 249 them now. That life was over. I did not think he had syphilis. It was not a serious disease anyway if you took it in time, they said. But he would worry. I would worry too if I had it. Any one would worry. I was not made to think. I was made to eat. My God, yes. Eat and drink and sleep with Catherine. To-night maybe. No that was impossible. But to- morrow night, and a good meal and sheets and never going away again except together. Probably have to go damned quickly. She would go. I knew she would go. When would we go ? That was something to think about. It was getting dark. I lay and thought where we would go. There were many places. BOOK IV CHAPTER XXXIII I dropped off the train in Milan as it slowed to come into the station early in the morning before it was light. I crossed the track and came out between some build- ings and down onto the street. A wine shop was open and I went in for some coffee. It smelled of early morning, of swept dust, spoons in coffee-glasses and the wet circles left by wine-glasses. The proprietor was behind the bar. Two soldiers sat at a table. I stood at the bar and drank a glass of coffee and ate a piece of bread. The coffee was gray with milk, and I skimmed the milk scum off the top with a piece of bread. The proprietor looked at me. "You want a glass of grappa?" "No thanks." "On me," he said and poured a small glass and pushed it toward me. "What's happening at the front ?" "I would not know." "They are drunk," he said, moving his hand toward the two soldiers. I could believe him. They looked drunk. "Tell me," he said, "what is happening at the front?" "I would not know about the front." "I saw you come down the wall. You came off the train." "There is a big retreat." "I read the papers. What happens? Is it over?" "I don't think so." He filled the glass with grappa from a short bottle. "If you are in trouble," he said, "I can keep you." *S3 254 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "lam not in trouble." "If you are in trouble stay here with me." "Where does one stay?" "In the building. Many stay here. Any who are in trouble stay here." "Are many in trouble?" "It depends on the trouble. You are a South Ameri- can?" "No." "Speak Spanish?" "A little." He wiped off the bar. "It is hard now to leave the country but in no way impossible." "I have no wish to leave." "You can stay here as long as you want. You will see what sort of man I am." "I have to go this morning but I will remember the address to return." He shook his head. "You won't come back if you talk like that. I thought you were in real trouble." "I am in no trouble. But I value the address of a friend." I put a ten-lira note on the bar to pay for the coffee. "Have a grappa with me," I said. "It is not necessary." "Have one." He poured the two glasses. "Remember," he said. "Come here. Do not let other people take you in. Here you are all right." "I am sure." "You are sure?" "Yes." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 255 He was serious. "Then let me tell you one thing. Do not go about with that coat." "Why?" "On the sleeves it shows very plainly where the stars have been cut away. The cloth is a different color." I did not say anything. "If you have no papers I can give you papers." "What papers?" "Leave-papers." "I have no need for papers. I have papers." "All right," he said. "But if you need papers I can get what you wish." "How much are such papers?" "It depends on what they are. The price is reason- able." "I don't need any now." He shrugged his shoulders. "I'm all right," I said. When I went out he said, "Don't forget that I am your friend." "No." "I will see you again," he said. f 'Good," I said. Outside I kept away from the station, where there were military police, and picked up a cab at the edge of the little park. I gave the driver the address of the hospital. At the hospital I went to the porter's lodge. His wife embraced me. He shook my hand. "You are back. You are safe." "Yes." "Have you had breakfast?" "Yes." "How are you, Tenente? How are you?" the wife asked. 256 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Fine." "Won't you have breakfast with us?" "No, thank you. Tell me is Miss Barkley here at the hospital now?" "Miss Barkley?" "The English lady nurse." "His girl," the wife said. She patted my arm and smiled. "No," the porter said. "She is away." My heart went down. "You are sure? I mean the tall blonde English young lady." "I am sure. She is gone to Stresa." "When did she go?" "She went two days ago with the other lady Eng- lish." "Good," I said. "I wish you to do something for me. Do not tell any one you have seen me. It is very im- portant." "I won't tell any one," the porter said. I gave him a ten-lira note. He pushed it away. "I promise you I will tell no one," he said. "I don't want any money." "What can we do for you, Signor Tenente?" his wife asked. "Only that," I said. "We are dumb," the porter said. "You will let me know anything I can do ?" "Yes," I said. "Good-by. I will see you again." They stood in the door, looking after me. I got into the cab and gave the driver the address of Simmons, one of the men I knew who was studying singing. Simmons lived a long way out in the town toward A FAREWELL TO ARMS 257 the Porta Magenta. He was still in bed and sleepy when I went to see him. "You get up awfully early, Henry," he said. "I came in on the early train." "What's all this retreat? Were you at the front? Will you have a cigarette? They're in that box on the table." It was a big room with a bed beside the wall, a piano over on the far side and a dresser and table. I sat on a chair by the bed. Simmons sat propped up by the pillows and smoked. "I'm in a jam, Sim," I said. "So am I," he said. "I'm always in a jam. Won't you smoke?" "No," I said. "What's the procedure in going to Switzerland?" "For you? The Italians wouldn't let you out of the country." "Yes. I know that. But the Swiss. What will they do?" "They intern you." "I know. But what's the mechanics of it?" "Nothing. It's very simple. You can go anywhere. I think you just have to report or something. Why? Are you fleeing the police?" "Nothing definite yet." "Don't tell me if you don't want. But it would be interesting to hear. Nothing happens here. I was a great flop at Piacenza." "I'm awfully sorry." "Oh yes â€” I went very badly. I sung well too. I'm going to try it again at the Lyrico here." "I'd like to be there." "You're awfully polite. You aren't in a bad mess, are you?" 258 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "I don't know." "Don't tell me if you don't want. How do you hap- pen to be away from the bloody front?" "I think I'm through with it." "Good boy. I always knew you had sense. Can I help you any way?" "You're awfully busy." "Not a bit of it, my dear Henry. Not a bit of it. I'd be happy to do anything." "You're about my size. Would you go out and buy me an outfit of civilian clothes ? I've clothes but they're all at Rome." "You did live there, didn't you? It's a filthy place. How did you ever live there?" "I wanted to be an architect." "That's no place for that. Don't buy clothes. I'll give you all the clothes you want. I'll fit you out so you'll be a great success. Go in that dressing-room. There's a closet. Take anything you want. My dear fellow, you don't want to buy clothes." "I'd rather buy them, Sim." "My dear fellow, it's easier for me to let you have them than go out and buy them. Have you got a pass- port? You won't get far without a passport." "Yes. I've still got my passport." "Then get dressed, my dear fellow, and off to old Helvetia." "It's not that simple. I have to go up to Stresa first." "Ideal, my dear fellow. You just row a boat across. If I wasn't trying to sing, I'd go with you. I'll go yet." "You could take up yodelling." "My dear fellow, I'll take up yodelling yet. I really can sing though. That's the strange part." "I'll bet you can sing." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 259 He lay back in bed smoking a cigarette. "Don't bet too much. But I can sing though. It's damned funny, but I can. I like to sing. Listen." He roared into "Africana," his neck swelling, the veins standing out. "I can sing," he said. "Whether they like it or not." I looked out of the window. "I'll go down and let my cab go." "Come back up, my dear fellow, and we'll have break- fast" He stepped out of bed, stood straight, took a deep breath and commenced doing bending exercises. I went downstairs and paid off the cab. CHAPTER XXXIV In civilian clothes I felt a masquerader. I had been in uniform a long time and I missed the feeling of being held by your clothes. The trousers felt very floppy. I had bought a ticket at Milan for Stresa. I had also bought a new hat. I could not wear Sim's hat but his clothes were fine. They smelled of tobacco and as I sat in the compartment and looked out the win- dow the new hat felt very new and the clothes very old. I myself felt as sad as the wet Lombard country that was outside through the window. There were some aviators in the compartment who did not think much of me. They avoided looking at me and were very scornful of a civilian my age. I did not feel insulted. In the old days I would have insulted them and picked a fight. They got off at Gallarate and I was glad to be alone. I had the paper but I did not read it because I did not want to read about the war. I was going to forget the war. I had made a separate peace. I felt damned lonely and was glad when the train got to Stresa. At the station I had expected to see the porters from the hotels but there was no one. The season had been over a long time and no one met the train. I got down from the train with my bag, it was Sim's bag, and very light to carry, being empty except for two shirts, and stood under the roof of the station in the rain while the train went on. I found a man in the station and asked him if he knew what hotels were open. The Grand- Hotel & des Isles Borromees was open and several small hotels that stayed open all the year. I started in the 260 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 261 rain for the Isles Borromees carrying my bag. I saw a carriage coming down the street and signalled to the driver. It was better to arrive in a carriage. We drove up to the carriage entrance of the big hotel and the con- cierge came out with an umbrella and was very polite. I took a good room. It was very big and light and looked out on the lake. The clouds were down over the lake but it would be beautiful with the sunlight. I was expecting my wife, I said. There was a big double bed, a letto matrimoniale with a satin coverlet. The hotel was very luxurious. I went down the long halls, down the wide stairs, through the rooms to the bar. I knew the barman and sat on a high stool and ate salted al- monds and potato chips. The martini felt cool and clean. "What are you doing here in borghese?" the barman asked after he had mixed a second martini. "I am on leave. Convalescing-leave." "There is no one here. I don't know why they keep the hotel open." "Have you been fishing ?" "I've caught some beautiful pieces. Trolling this time of year you catch some beautiful pieces." "Did you ever get the tobacco I sent?" "Yes. Didn't you get my card?" I laughed. I had not been able to get the tobacco. It was American pipe-tobacco that he wanted, but my relatives had stopped sending it or it was being held up. Anyway it never came. "I'll get some somewhere," I said. "Tell me have you seen two English girls in the town? They came here day before yesterday." "They are not at the hotel." "They are nurses." 262 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "I have seen two nurses. Wait a minute, I will find out where they are." "One of them is my wife," I said. "I have come here to meet her." "The other is my wife." "I am not joking." "Pardon my stupid joke," he said. "I did not under- stand." He went away and was gone quite a little while. I ate olives, salted almonds and potato chips and looked at myself in civilian clothes in the mirror be- hind the bar. The bartender came back. "They are at the little hotel near the station," he said. "How about some sandwiches ?" "I'll ring for some. You understand there is nothing here, now there are no people." "Isn't there really any one at all?" "Yes. There are a few people." The sandwiches came and I ate three and drank a couple more martinis. I had never tasted anything so cool and clean. They made me feel civilized. I had had too much red wine, bread, cheese, bad coffee and grappa. I sat on the high stool before the pleasant mahogany, the brass and the mirrors and did not think at all. The barman asked me some question. "Don't talk about the war," I said. The war was a long way away. Maybe there wasn't any war. There was no war here. Then I realized it was over for me. But I did not have the feeling that it was really over. I had the feeling of a boy who thinks of what is happen- ing at a certain hour at the schoolhouse from which he has played truant. Catherine and Helen Ferguson were at supper when I came to their hotel. Standing in the hallway I saw A FAREWELL TO ARMS 263 them at table. Catherine's face was away from me and I saw the line of her hair and her cheek and her lovely- neck and shoulders. Ferguson was talking. She stopped when I came in. "My God," she said. "Hello/' I said. "Why it's you!" Catherine said. Her face lighted up. She looked too happy to believe it. I kissed her. Catherine blushed and I sat down at the table. "You're a fine mess," Ferguson said. "What are you doing here? Have you eaten?" "No." The girl who was serving the meal came in and I told her to bring a plate for me. Catherine looked at me all the time, her eyes happy. "What are you doing in mufti ?" Ferguson asked. "I'm in the Cabinet." "You're in some mess." "Cheer up, Fergy. Cheer up just a little." "I'm not cheered by seeing you. I know the mess you've gotten this girl into. You're no cheerful sight to me." Catherine smiled at me and touched me with her foot under the table. "No one got me in a mess, Fergy. I get in my own messes." "I can't stand him," Ferguson said. "He's done nothing hut ruin you with his sneaking Italian tricks. Americans are worse than Italians." "The Scotch are such a moral people," Catherine said. "I don't mean that. I mean his Italian sneakiness." "Am I sneaky, Fergy?" "You are. You're worse than sneaky. You're like a 264 A FAREWELL TO ARMS snake. A snake with an Italian uniform: with a cape around your neck." "I haven't got an Italian uniform now." "That's just another example of your sneakiness. You had a love affair all summer and got this girl with child and now I suppose you'll sneak off." I smiled at Catherine and she smiled at me. "We'll both sneak off," she said. "You're two of the same thing," Ferguson said. "I'm ashamed of you, Catherine Barkley. You have no shame and no honor and you're as sneaky as he is." "Don't, Fergy," Catherine said and patted her hand. "Don't denounce me. You know we like each other." "Take your hand away," Ferguson said. Her face was red. "If you had any shame it would be different. But you're God knows how many months gone with child and you think it's a joke and are all smiles because your seducer's come back. You've no shame and no feelings." She began to cry. Catherine went over and put her arm around her. As she stood comforting Fer- guson, I could see no change in her figure. "I don't care," Ferguson sobbed. "I think it's dread- ful." "There, there, Fergy," Catherine comforted her. "I'll be ashamed. Don't cry, Fergy. Don't cry, old Fergy." "I'm not crying," Ferguson sobbed. "I'm not crying. Except for the awful thing you've gotten into." She looked at me. "I hate you," she said. "She can't make me not hate you. You dirty sneaking American Ital- ian." Her eyes and nose were red with crying. Catherine smiled at me. "Don't you smile at him with your arm around me." "You're unreasonable, Fergy." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 265 "I know it," Ferguson sobbed. "You mustn't mind me, either of you. I'm so upset. I'm not reasonable. I know it. I want you both to be happy." "We're happy," Catherine said. "You're a sweet Fergy." Ferguson cried again. "I don't want you happy the way you are. Why don't you get married ? You haven't got another wife have you?" "No," I said. Catherine laughed. "It's nothing to laugh about," Ferguson said. "Plenty of them have other wives." "We'll be married, Fergy," Catherine said, "if it will please you." "Not to please me. You should want to be married." "We've been very busy." "Yes. I know. Busy making babies." I thought she was going to cry again but she went into bitterness instead. "I suppose you'll go off with him now to- night?" "Yes," said Catherine. "If he wants me." "What about me?" "Are you afraid to stay here alone?" "Yes, I am." "Then I'll stay with you." "No, go on with him. Go with him right away. I'm sick of seeing both of you." "We'd better finish dinner." "No. Go right away." "Fergy, be reasonable." "I say get out right away. Go away both of you." "Let's go then," I said. I was sick of Fergy. "You do want to go. You see you want to leave me even to eat dinner alone. I've always wanted to go to 266 A FAREWELL TO ARMS the Italian lakes and this is how it is. Oh, Oh," she sobbed, then looked at Catherine and choked. "We'll stay till after dinner," Catherine said. "And ril not leave you alone if you want me to stay. I won't leave you alone, Fergy." "No. No. I want you to go. I want you to go." She wiped her eyes. "I'm so unreasonable. Please don't mind me." The girl who served the meal had been upset by all the crying. Now as she brought in the next course she seemed relieved that things were better. That night at the hotel, in our room with the long empty hall outside and our shoes outside the door, a thick carpet on the floor of the room, outside the win- dows the rain falling and in the room light and pleas- ant and cheerful, then the light out and it exciting with smooth sheets and the bed comfortable, feeling that we had come home, feeling no longer alone, waking in the night to find the other one there, and not gone away; all other things were unreal. We slept when we were tired and if we woke the other one woke too so one was not alone. Often a man wishes to be alone and a girl wishes to be alone too and if they love each other they are jealous of that in each other, but I can truly say we never felt that. We could feel alone when we were together, alone against the others. It has only happened to me like that once. I have been alone while I was with many girls and that is the way that you can be most lonely. But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together. I know that the night is not the same as the day : that all things are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can A FAREWELL TO ARMS 267 be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneli- ness has started. But with Catherine there was almost no difference in the night except that it was an even better time. If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry. I remember waking in the morning. Catherine was asleep and the sunlight was coming in through the win- dow. The rain had stopped and I stepped out of bed and across the floor to the window. Down below were the gardens, bare now but beautifully regular, the gravel paths, the trees, the stone wall by the lake and the lake in the sunlight with the mountains beyond. I stood at the window looking out and when I turned away I saw Catherine was awake and watching me. "How are you, darling ?" she said. "Isn't it a lovely day?" "How do you feel ?" "I feel very well. We had a lovely night." "Do you want breakfast?" She wanted breakfast. So did I and we had it in bed, the November sunlight coming in the window, and the breakfast tray across my lap. "Don't you want the paper? You always wanted the paper in the hospital." "No," I said. "I don't want the paper now." "Was it so bad you don't want even to read about it?" 268 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "I don't want to read about it" "I wish I had been with you so I would know about it too." 'Til tell you about it if I ever get it straight in my head." "But won't they arrest you if they catch you out of uniform?" "They'll probably shoot me." "Then we'll not stay here. We'll get out of the country." "I'd thought something of that." "We'll get out. Darling, you shouldn't take silly chances. Tell me how did you come from Mestre to Milan?" "I came on the train. I was in uniform then." "Weren't you in danger then?" "Not much. I had an old order of movement. I fixed the dates on it in Mestre." "Darling, you're liable to be arrested here any time. I won't have it. It's silly to do something like that. Where would we be if they took you off?" "Let's not think about it. I'm tired of thinking about it." "What would you do if they came to arrest you?" "Shoot them." "You see how silly you are, I won't let you go out of the hotel until we leave here." "Where are we going to go?" "Please don't be that way, darling. We'll go where- ever you say. But please find some place to go right away." "Switzerland is down the lake, we can go there." "That will be lovely." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 269 It was clouding over outside and the lake was dark- ening. "1 wish we did not always have to live like crimi- nals," I said. "Darling, don't be that way. You haven't lived like a criminal very long. And we never live like criminals. We're going to have a fine time." "I feel like a criminal. I've deserted from the army." "Darling, please be sensible. It's not deserting from the army. It's only the Italian army." I laughed. "You're a fine girl. Let's get back into bed. I feel fine in bed." A little while later Catherine said, "You don't feel like a criminal do you?" "No," I said. "Not when I'm with you." "You're such a silly boy," she said. "But I'll look after you. Isn't it splendid, darling, that I don't have any morning-sickness?" "It's grand." "You don't appreciate what a fine wife you have. But I don't care. I'll get you some place where they can't arrest you and then we'll have a lovely time." "Let's go there right away." "We will, darling. I'll go any place any time you wish." "Let's not think about anything." "All right." CHAPTER XXXV Catherine went along the lake to the little hotel to see Ferguson and I sat in the bar and read the papers. There were comfortable leather chairs in the bar and I sat in one of them and read until the barman came in. The army had not stood at the Tagliamento. They were falling back to the Piave. I remembered the Piave. The railroad crossed it near San Dona going up to the front. It was deep and slow there and quite narrow. Down below there were mosquito marshes and canals. There were some lovely villas. Once, be- fore the war, going up to Cortina D'Ampezzo I had gone along it for several hours in the hills. Up there it looked like a trout stream, flowing swiftly with shal- low stretches and pools under the shadow of the rocks. The road turned off from it at Cadore. I wondered how the army that was up there would come down. The barman came in. "Count Greffi was asking for you," he said. "Who?" "Count Grefifi. You remember the old man who was here when you were here before." "Is he here?" "Yes, he's here with his niece. I told him you were here. He wants you to play billiards." "Where is he?" "He's taking a walk." "How is he?" "He's younger than ever. He drank three cham- pagne cocktails last night before dinner." "How's his billiard game?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 271 "Good. He beat me. When I told him you were here he was very pleased. There's nobody here for him to play with." Count Greffi was ninety- four years old. He had been a contemporary of Metternich and was an old man with white hair and mustache and beautiful man- ners. He had been in the diplomatic service of both Austria and Italy and his birthday parties were the great social event of Milan. He was living to be one hundred years old and played a smoothly fluent game of billiards that contrasted with his own ninety- four- year-old brittleness. I had met him when I had been at Stresa once before out of season and while we played billiards we drank champagne. I thought it was a splendid custom and he gave me fifteen points in a hundred and beat me. "Why didn't you tell me he was here?" "I forgot it." "Who else is here?" "No one you know. There are only six people alto- gether." "What are you doing now?" "Nothing." "Come on out fishing." "I could come for an hour." "Come on. Bring the trolling line." The barman put on a coat and we went out. We went down and got a boat and I rowed while the bar- man sat in the stern and let out the line with a spinner and a heavy sinker on the end to troll for lake trout. We rowed along the shore, the barman holding the line in his hand and giving it occasional jerks forward. Stresa looked very deserted from the lake. There were the long rows of bare trees, the big hotels and the 272 A FAREWELL TO ARMS closed villas. I rowed across to Isola Bella and went close to the walls, where the water deepened sharply, and you saw the rock wall slanting down in the clear water, and then up and along to the fisherman's island. The sun was under a cloud and the water was dark and smooth and very cold. We did not have a strike though we saw some circles on the water from rising fish. I rowed up opposite the fisherman's island where there were boats drawn up and men were mending nets. "Should we get a drink?" "All right. ,, I brought the boat up to the stone pier and the bar- man pulled in the line, coiling it on the bottom of the boat and hooking the spinner on the edge of the gun- wale. I stepped out and tied the boat. We went into a little cafe, sat at a bare wooden table and ordered ver- mouth. "Are you tired from rowing?" "No." "I'll row back," he said. "I like to row." "Maybe if you hold the line it will change the luck." "All right." "Tell me how goes the war." "Rotten." "I don't have to go. I'm too old, like Count Greffi." "Maybe you'll have to go yet." "Next year they'll call my class. But I won't go." "What will you do?" "Get out of the country. I wouldn't go to war. I was at the war once in Abyssinia. Nix. Why do you go? "I don't know. I was a fool." "Have another vermouth?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 273 "All right." The barman rowed back. We trolled up the lake be- yond Stresa and then down not far from shore. I held the taut line and felt the faint pulsing of the spin- ner revolving while I looked at the dark November water of the lake and the deserted shore. The barman rowed with long strokes and on the forward thrust of the boat the line throbbed. Once I had a strike: the line hardened suddenly and jerked back, I pulled and felt the live weight of the trout and then the line throbbed again. I had missed him. "Did he feel big?" "Pretty big." "Once when I was out trolling alone I had the line in my teeth and one struck and nearly took my mouth out" "The best way is to have it over your leg," I said. "Then you feel it and don't lose your teeth." I put my hand in the water. It was very cold. We were almost opposite the hotel now. "I have to go in," the barman said, "to be there for eleven o'clock. L'heure du cocktail/' "All right." I pulled in the line and wrapped it on a stick notched at each end. The barman put the boat in a little slip in the stone wall and locked it with a chain and padlock. "Any time you want it," he said, "I'll give you the key." " "Thanks." We went up to the hotel and in to the bar. I did not want another drink so early in the morning so I went up to our room. The maid had just finished doing the room and Catherine was not back yet. I lay down on the bed and tried to keep from thinking. 274 A FAREWELL TO ARMS When Catherine came back it was all right again. Ferguson was downstairs, she said. She was coming to lunch. "I knew you wouldn't mind," Catherine said. "No," I said. "What's the matter, darling?" "I don't know." "I know. You haven't anything to do. All you have is me and I go away." "That's true." "I'm sorry, darling. I know it must be a dreadful feeling to have nothing at all suddenly." "My life used to be full of everything," I said. "Now if you aren't with me I haven't a thing in the world." "But I'll be with you. I was only gone for two hours. Isn't there anything you can do?" "I went fishing with the barman." "Wasn't it fun?" "Yes." "Don't think about me when I'm not here." "That's the way I worked it at the front. But there was something to do then." "Othello with his occupation gone," she teased. "Othello was a nigger," I said. "Besides, I'm not jealous. I'm just so in love with you that there isn't anything else." "Will you be a good boy and be nice to Ferguson?" "I'm always nice to Ferguson unless she curses me." "Be nice to her. Think how much we have and she hasn't anything." "I don't think she wants what we have." "You don't know much, darling, for such a wise boy." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 275 'Til be nice to her." "I know you will. You're so sweet." "She won't stay afterward, will she?" "No. I'll get rid of her." "And then we'll come up here." "Of course. What do you think I want to do?" We went downstairs to have lunch with Ferguson. She was very impressed by the hotel and the splendor of the dining-room. We had a good lunch with a couple of bottles of white capri. Count Greffi came into the dining-room and bowed to us. His niece, who looked a little like my grandmother, was with him. I told Catherine and Ferguson about him and Ferguson was very impressed. The hotel was very big and grand and empty but the food was good, the wine was very pleasant and finally the wine made us all feel very well. Catherine had no need to feel any better. She was very happy. Ferguson became quite cheerful. I felt very well myself. After lunch Ferguson went back to her hotel. She was going to lie down for a while after lunch she said. Along late in the afternoon some one knocked on our door. "Who is it?" "The Count Greffi wishes to know if you will play billiards with him." I looked at my watch ; I had taken it off and it was under the pillow. "Do you have to go, darling?" Catherine whispered. "I think Td better." The watch was a quarter-past four o'clock. Out loud I said, "Tell the Count Greffi I will be in the billiard-room at five o'clock." At a quarter to five I kissed Catherine good-by and went into the bathroom to dress. Knotting my tie and 276 A FAREWELL TO ARMS looking in the glass I looked strange to myself in the civilian clothes. I must remember to buy some more shirts and socks. "Will you be away a long time?" Catherine asked. She looked lovely in the bed. "Would you hand me the brush?" I watched her brushing her hair, holding her head so the weight of her hair all came on one side. It was dark outside and the light over the head of the bed shone on her hair and on her neck and shoulders. I went over and kissed her and held her hand with the brush and her head sunk back on the pillow. I kissed her neck and shoulders. I felt faint with loving her so much. "I don't want to go away." "I don't want you to go away." "I won't go then." "Yes. Go. It's only for a little while and then you'll come back." "We'll have dinner up here." "Hurry and come back." I found the Count Greffi in the billiard-room. He was practising strokes, looking very fragile under the light that came down above the billiard table. On a card table a little way beyond the light was a silver icing- bucket with the necks and corks of two champagne bottles showing above the ice. The Count Greffi straightened up when I came toward the table and walked toward me. He put out his hand, "It is such a great pleasure that you are here. You were very kind to come to play with me." "It was very nice of you to ask me." "Are you quite well? They told me you were A FAREWELL TO ARMS 277 wounded on the Isonzo. I hope you are well again." "I'm very well. Have you been well?" "Oh, I am always well. But I am getting old. I detect signs of age now." "I can't believe it." "Yes. Do you want to know one? It is easier for me to talk Italian. I discipline myself but I find when I am tired that it is so much easier to talk Italian. So I know I must be getting old." "We could talk Italian. I am a little tired too." "Oh, but when you are tired it will be easier for you to talk English." "American." "Yes. American. You will please talk American. It is a delightful language." "I hardly ever see Americans." "You must miss them. One misses one's country- men and especially one's countrywomen. I know that experience. Should we play or are you too tired?" "I'm not really tired. I said that for a joke. What handicap will you give me?" "Have you been playing very much?" "None at all." "You play very well. Ten points in a hundred?" "You flatter me." "Fifteen?" "That would be fine but you will beat me." "Should we play for a stake? You always wished to play for a stake." "I think we'd better." "All right. I will give you eighteen points and we will play for a franc a point." He played a lovely game of billiards and with the 278 A FAREWELL TO ARMS handicap I was only four ahead at fifty. Count Greffi pushed a button on the wall to ring for the barman. "Open one bottle please/' he said. Then to me, "We will take a little stimulant." The wine was icy cold and very dry and good. "Should we talk Italian? Would you mind very much? It is my great weakness now." We went on playing, sipping the wine between shots, speaking in Italian, but talking little, concentrated on the game. Count Greffi made his one hundredth point and with the handicap I was only at ninety-four. He smiled and patted me on the shoulder. "Now we will drink the other bottle and you will tell me about the war." He waited for me to sit down. "About anything else," I said. "You don't want to talk about it? Good. What have you been reading?" "Nothing," I said. "I'm afraid I am very dull." "No. But you should read." "What is there written in war-time?" "There is 'Le Feu* by a Frenchman, Barbusse. There is 'Mr. Britling Sees Through It/ " "No, he doesn't." "What?" "He doesn't see through it. Those books were at the hospital." "Then you have been reading?" "Yes, but nothing any good." "I thought 'Mr. Britling' a very good study of the English middle-class soul." "I don't know about the soul." "Poor boy. We none of us know about the soul. Are you Croyant?" "At night." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 279 Count Greffi smiled and turned the glass with his fin- gers. "I had expected to become more devout as I grow older but somehow I haven't," he said. "It is a great pity." "Would you like to live after death?" I asked and instantly felt a fool to mention death. But he did not mind the word. "It would depend on the life. This life is very pleas- ant. I would like to live forever," he smiled. "I very nearly have." We were sitting in the deep leather chairs, the cham- pagne in the ice-bucket and our glasses on the table between us. "If you ever live to be as old as I am you will find many things strange." "You never seem old." "It is the body that is old. Sometimes I am afraid I will break off a finger as one breaks a stick of chalk. And the spirit is no older and not much wiser." "You are wise." "No, that is the great fallacy; the wisdom of old men. They do not grow wise. They grow careful." "Perhaps that is wisdom." "It is a very unattractive wisdom. What do you value most?" "Some one I love." "With me it is the same. That is not wisdom. Do you value life?" "Yes." "So do I. Because it is all I have. And to give birthday parties," he laughed. "You are probably wiser than I am. You do not give birthday parties." We both drank the wine. "What do you think of the war really?" I asked. 280 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "I think it is stupid." "Who will win it?" "Italy." "Why?" "They are a younger nation." "Do younger nations always win wars?" "They are apt to for a time." "Then what happens?" "They become older nations." "You said you were not wise." "Dear boy, that is not wisdom. That is cynicism." "It sounds very wise to me." "It's not particularly. I could quote you the ex- amples on the other side. But it is not bad. Have we finished the champagne?" "Almost." "Should we drink some more? Then I must dress." "Perhaps we'd better not now." "You are sure you don't want more?" "Yes." He stood up. "I hope you will be very fortunate and very happy and very, very healthy." "Thank you. And I hope you will live forever." "Thank you. I have. And if you ever become de- vout pray for me if I am dead. I am asking several of my friends to do that. I had expected to become de- vout myself but it has not come." I thought he smiled sadly but I could not tell. He was so old and his face was very wrinkled, so that a smile used so many lines that all gradations were lost. "I might become very devout," I said. "Anyway, I will pray for you." "I had always expected to become devout. All my A FAREWELL TO ARMS 281 family died very devout. But somehow it does not come. "T4.> It's too early." "Maybe it is too late. Perhaps I have outlived my religious feeling." "My own comes only at night." "Then too you are in love. Do not forget that is a religious feeling." "You believe so?" "Of course." He took a step toward the table. "You were very kind to play." "It was a great pleasure." "We will walk up stairs together."- CHAPTER XXXVI That night there was a storm and I woke to hear the rain lashing the window-panes. It was coming in the open window. Some one had knocked on the door. I went to the door very softly, not to disturb Catherine, and opened it. The barman stood there. He wore his overcoat and carried his wet hat. "Can I speak to you, Tenente?" "What's the matter ?" "It's a very serious matter/' I looked around. The room was dark. I saw the water on the floor from the window. "Come in," I said. I took him by the arm into the bathroom ; locked the door and put on the light. I sat down on the edge of the bathtub. "What's the matter, Emilio? Are you in trouble?" "No. You are, Tenente." "Yes?" "They are going to arrest you in the morning." "Yes?" "I came to tell you. I was out in the town and I heard them talking in a cafe." 1 see. He stood there, his coat wet, holding his wet hat and said nothing. "Why are they going to arrest me?" "For something about the war." "Do you know what?" "No. But I know that they know you were here be- fore as an officer and now you are here out of uniform. After this retreat they arrest everybody." I thought a minute. 282 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 283 "What time do they come to arrest me?" "In the morning. I don't know the time." "What do you say to do?" He put his hat in the washbowl. It was very wet and had been dripping on the floor. "If you have nothing to fear an arrest is nothing. But it is always bad to be arrested â€” especially now." "I don't want to be arrested." "Then go to Switzerland." "How?" "In my boat." "There is a storm," I said. "The storm is over. It is rough but you will be all right" "When should we go?" "Right away. They might come to arrest you early in the morning." "What about our bags?" "Get them packed. Get your lady dressed. I will take care of them." "Where will you be?" "I will wait here. I don't want any one to see me outside in the hall." I opened the door, closed it, and went into the bed- room. Catherine was awake. "What is it, darling?" "It's all right, Cat," I said. "Would you like to get dressed right away and go in a boat to Switzerland?" "Would you?" "No," I said. "I'd like to go back to bed." "What is it about?" "The barman says they are going to arrest me in the morning." "Is the barman crazy?" 284 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "No." "Then please hurry, darling, and get dressed so we can start." She sat up on the side of the bed. She was still sleepy. "Is that the barman in the bathroom?" "Yes." "Then I won't wash. Please look the other way, darling, and I'll be dressed in just a minute." I saw her white back as she took off her nightgown and then I looked away because she wanted me to. She was beginning to be a little big with the child and she did not want me to see her. I dressed hearing the rain on the windows. I did not have much to put in my bag. "There's plenty of room in my bag, Cat, if you need any." "I'm almost packed," she said. "Darling, I'm aw- fully stupid, but why is the barman in the bathroom?" "Sh â€” he's waiting to take our bags down." "He's awfully nice." "He's an old friend," I said. "I nearly sent him some pipe-tobacco once." I looked out the open window at the dark night. I could not see the lake, only the dark and the rain but the wind was quieter. "I'm ready, darling," Catherine said. "All right." I went to the bathroom door. "Here are the bags, Emilio," I said. The barman took the two bags. "You're very good to help us," Catherine said. "That's nothing, lady," the barman said. "I'm glad to help you just so I don't get in trouble myself. Lis- ten," he said to me. "I'll take these out the servants' stairs and to the boat. You just go out as though you were going for a walk." "It's a lovely night for a walk," Catherine said. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 285 "It's a bad night all right." "I'm glad Fve an umbrella," Catherine said. We walked down the hall and down the wide thickly- carpeted stairs. At the foot of the stairs by the door the porter sat behind his desk. He looked surprised at seeing us. " You're not going out, sir?" he said. "Yes," I said. "We're going to see the storm along the lake." "Haven't you got an umbrella, sir?" "No," I said. "This coat sheds water." He looked at it doubtfully. 'Til get you an umbrella, sir," he said. He went away and came back with a big umbrella. "It is a little big, sir," he said. I gave him a ten-lira note. "Oh you are too good, sir. Thank you very much," he said. He held the door open and we went out into the rain. He smiled at Catherine and she smiled at him. "Don't stay out in the storm," he said. "You will get wet, sir and lady." He was only the sec- ond porter, and his English was still literally translated. "We'll be back," I said. We walked down the path under the giant umbrella and out through the dark wet gardens to the road and across the road to the trellised pathway along the lake. The wind was blowing off- shore now. It was a cold, wet November wind and I knew it was snowing in the mountains. We came along past the chained boats in the slips along the quay to where the barman's boat should be. The water was dark against the stone. The barman stepped out from beside the row of trees. "The bags are in the boat," he said. "I want to pay you for the boat," I said. "How much money have you?" "Not so much." 286 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "You send me the money later. That will be all right" "How much?" "What you want." "Tell me how much." "If you get through send me five hundred francs. You won't mind that if you get through/ ' "All right." "Here are sandwiches/' He handed me a package. "Everything there was in the bar. It's all here. This is a bottle of brandy and a bottle of wine." I put them in my bag. "Let me pay you for those." "All right, give me fifty lire." I gave it to him. "The brandy is good," he said. "You don't need to be afraid to give it to your lady. She better get in the boat." He held the boat, it rising and falling against the stone wall and I helped Cathe- rine in. She sat in the stern and pulled her cape around her. "You know where to go?" "Up the lake." "You know how far?" "Past Luino." "Past Luino, Cannero, Cannobio, Tranzano. You aren't in Switzerland until you come to Brissago. You have to pass Monte Tamara." "What time is it?" Catherine asked. "It's only eleven o'clock," I said. "If you row all the time you ought to be there by seven o'clock in the morning." "Is it that far?" "It's thirty-five kilometres." "How should we go? In this rain we need a com- pass." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 287 "No. Row to Isola Bella. Then on the other side of Isola Madre go with the wind. The wind will take you to Pallanza. You will see the lights. Then go up the shore." "Maybe the wind will change." "No," he said. "This wind will blow like this for three days. It comes straight down from the Matta- rone. There is a can to bail with." "Let me pay you something for the boat now." "No, Fd rather take a chance. If you get through you pay me all you can." "All right" "I don't think you'll get drowned." "That's good." "Go with the wind up the lake." "All right." I stepped in the boat. "Did you leave the money for the hotel?" "Yes. In an envelope in the room." "All right. Good luck, Tenente." "Good luck. We thank you many times." "You won't thank me if you get drowned." "What does he say?" Catherine asked. "He says good luck." "Good luck," Catherine said. "Thank you very much." "Are you ready?" "Yes." He bent down and shoved us off. I dug at the water with the oars, then waved one hand. The barman waved back deprecatingly. I saw the lights of the hotel and rowed out, rowing straight out until they were out of sight. There was quite a sea running but we were go- ing with the wind. CHAPTER XXXVII I rowed in the dark keeping the wind in my face. The rain had stopped and only came occasionally in gusts. It was very dark, and the wind was cold. I could see Catherine in the stern but I could not see the water where the blades of the oars dipped. The oars were long and there were no leathers to keep them from slipping out. I pulled, raised, leaned forward, found the water, dipped and pulled, rowing as easily as I could. I did not feather the oars because the wind was with us. I knew my hands would blister and I wanted to delay it as long as I could. The boat was light and rowed easily. I pulled it along in the dark water. I could not see, and hoped we would soon come opposite Pallanza. We never saw Pallanza. The wind was blowing up the lake and we passed the point that hides Pallanza in the dark and never saw the lights. When we finally saw some lights much further up the lake and close to the shore it was Intra. But for a long time we did not see any lights, nor did we see the shore but rowed stead- ily in the dark riding with the waves. Sometimes I missed the water with the oars in the dark as a wave lifted the boat. It was quite rough; but I kept on row- ing, until suddenly we were close ashore against a point of rock that rose beside us ; the waves striking against it, rushing high up, then falling back. I pulled hard on the right oar and backed water with the other and we went out into the lake again ; the point was out of sight and we were going on up the lake. "We're across the lake/' I said to Catherine. 288 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 289 "Weren't we going to see Pallanza ?" "We've missed it." "How are you, darling?" "I'm fine." "I could take the oars awhile." "No, Tm fine." "Poor Ferguson," Catherine said. "In the morning she'll come to the hotel and find we're gone." "I'm not worrying so much about that," I said, "as about getting into the Swiss part of the lake before it's daylight and the custom guards see us." "Is it a long way?" "It's thirty some kilometres from here." I rowed all night. Finally my hands were so sore I could hardly close them over the oars. We were nearly smashed up on the shore several times. I kept fairly close to the shore because I was afraid of getting lost on the lake and losing time. Sometimes we were so close we could see a row of trees and the road along the shore with the mountains behind. The rain stopped and the wind drove the clouds so that the moon shone through and looking back I could see the long dark point of Castagnola and the lake with white-caps and beyond, the moon on the high snow mountains. Then the clouds came over the moon again and the moun- tains and the lake were gone, but it w r as much lighter than it had been before and we could see the shore. I could see it too clearly and pulled out where they would not see the boat if there were custom guards along the Pallanza road. When the moon came out again we could see white villas on the shore on the slopes of the mountain and the white road where it showed through the trees. All the time I was rowing. 290 A FAREWELL TO ARMS The lake widened and across it on the shore at the foot of the mountains on the other side we saw a few lights that should be Luino. I saw a wedgelike gap be- tween the mountains on the other shore and I thought that must be Luino. If it was we were making good time. I pulled in the oars and lay back on the seat. I was very, very tired of rowing. My arms and shoulders and back ached and my hands were sore. "I could hold the umbrella/' Catherine said. "We could sail with that with the wind." "Can you steer?" "I think so." "You take this oar and hold it under your arm close to the side of the boat and steer and HI hold the um- brella." I went back to the stern and showed her how to hold the oar. I took the big umbrella the porter had given me and sat facing the bow and opened it. It opened with a clap. I held it on both sides, sitting astride the handle hooked over the seat. The wind was full in it and I felt the boat suck forward while I held as hard as I could to the two edges. It pulled hard. The boat was moving fast. "We're going beautifully," Catherine said. All I could see was umbrella ribs. The umbrella strained and pulled and I felt us driving along with it. I braced my feet and held back on it, then suddenly, it buckled; I felt a rib snap on my forehead, I tried to grab the top that was bending with the wind and the whole thing buckled and went inside out and I was astride the handle of an inside-out, ripped umbrella, where I had been holding a wind-filled pulling sail. I unhooked the handle from the seat, laid the umbrella in the bow and went back to Catherine for the oar. She was laughing. She took my hand and kept on laughing. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 291 "What's the matter ?" I took the oar. "You looked so funny holding that thing." "I suppose so." "Don't be cross, darling. It was awfully funny. You looked about twenty feet broad and very affectionate holding the umbrella by the edges â€” " she choked. â€¢Til row." "Take a rest and a drink. It's a grand night and we've come a long way." "I have to keep the boat out of the trough of the waves." "I'll get you a drink. Then rest a little while, dar- ling." I held the oars up and we sailed with them. Cathe- rine was opening the bag. She handed me the brandy bottle. I pulled the cork with my pocket-knife and took a long drink. It was smooth and hot and the heat went all through me and I felt warmed and cheerful. "It's lovely brandy," I said. The moon was under again but I could see the shore. There seemed to be another point going out a long way ahead into the lake. "Are you warm enough, Cat?" "I'm splendid. I'm a little stiff." "Bail out that water and you can put your feet down." Then I rowed and listened to the oarlocks and the dip and scrape of the bailing tin under the stern seat. "Would you give me the bailer?" I said. "I want a drink." "It's awfully dirty." "That's all right. I'll rinse it." I heard Catherine rinsing it over the side. Then she handed it to me dipped full of water. I was thirsty after the brandy and the water was icy cold, so cold it 292 A FAREWELL TO ARMS made my teeth ache. I looked toward the shore. We were closer to the long point. There were lights in the bay ahead. "Thanks," Isaid and handed back the tin pail. "You're ever so welcome," Catherine said. "There's much more if you want it." "Don't you want to eat something?" "No. I'll be hungry in a little while. We'll save it till then." "All right." What looked like a point ahead was a long high headland. I went further out in the lake to pass it. The lake was much narrower now. The moon was out again and the guardia di Finanza could have seen our boat black on the water if they had been watching. "How are you, Cat?" I asked. "I'm all right Where are we?" "I don't think we have more than about eight miles more." "That's a long way to row, you poor sweet. Aren't you dead?" "No. I'm all right. My hands are sore is all." We went on up the lake. There was a break in the mountains on the right bank, a flattening-out with a low shore line that I thought must be Cannobio. I stayed a long way out because it was from now on that we ran the most danger of meeting guardia. There was a high dome-capped mountain on the other shore a way ahead. I was tired. It was no great distance to row but when you were out of condition it had been a long way. I knew I had to pass that mountain and go up the lake at least five miles further before we would be in Swiss water. The moon was almost down now but A FAREWELL TO ARMS 293 before it went down the sky clouded over again and it was very dark. I stayed well out in the lake, rowing awhile, then resting and holding the oars so that the wind struck the blades. "Let me row awhile," Catherine said. "I don't think you ought to." "Nonsense. It would be good for me. It would keep me from being too stiff." "I don't think you should, Cat." "Nonsense. Rowing in moderation is very good for the pregnant lady." "All right, you row a little moderately. I'll go back, then you come up. Hold on to both gunwales when you come up." I sat in the stern with my coat on and the collar turned up and watched Catherine row. She rowed very well but the oars were too long and bothered her. I opened the bag and ate a couple of sandwiches and took a drink of the brandy. It made everything much better and I took another drink. "Tell me when you're tired," I said. Then a little later, "watch out the oar doesn't pop you in the tummy." "If it did" â€” Catherine said between strokes â€” "life might be much simpler." I took another drink of the brandy. "How are you going?" "All right." "Tell me when you want to stop." "All right" I took another drink of the brandy, then took hold of the two gunwales of the boat and moved forward. "No. I'm going beautifully." "Go on back to the stern. I've had a grand rest." 294 A FAREWELL TO ARMS For a while, with the brandy, I rowed easily and steadily. Then I began to catch crabs and soon I was just chopping along again with a thin brown taste of bile from having rowed too hard after the brandy. "Give me a drink of water, will you?" I said. "That's easy," Catherine said. Before daylight it started to drizzle. The wind was down or we were protected by mountains that bounded the curve the lake had made. When I knew daylight was coming I settled down and rowed hard. I did not know where we were and I wanted to get into the Swiss part of the lake. When it was beginning to be daylight we were quite close to the shore. I could see the rocky shore and the trees. "What's that?" Catherine said. I rested on the oars and listened. It was a motor boat chugging out on the lake. I pulled close up to the shore and lay quiet. The chugging came closer; then we saw the motor boat in the rain a little astern of us. There were four guardia difinanza in the stern, their alpini hats pulled down, their cape collars turned up and their carbines slung across their backs. They all looked sleepy so early in the morn- ing. I could see the yellow on their hats and the yellow marks on their cape collars. The motor boat chugged on and out of sight in the rain. I pulled out into the lake. If we were that close to the border I did not want to be hailed by a sentry along the road. I stayed out where I could just see the shore and rowed on for three quarters of an hour in the rain. We heard a motor boat once more but I kept quiet un- til the noise of the engine went away across the lake. "I think we're in Switzerland, Cat," I said. "Really?" "There's no way to know until we see Swiss troops." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 295 "Or the Swiss navy." "The Swiss navy's no joke for us. That last motor boat we heard was probably the Swiss navy." "If we're in Switzerland let's have a big breakfast. They have wonderful rolls and butter and jam in Swit- zerland." It was clear daylight now and a fine rain was falling. The wind was still blowing outside up the lake and we could see the tops of the white-caps going away from us and up the lake. I was sure we were in Switzerland now. There were many houses back in the trees from the shore and up the shore a way was a village with stone houses, some villas on the hills and a church. I had been looking at the road that skirted the shore for guards but did not see any. The road came quite close to the lake now and I saw a soldier coming out of a cafe on the road. He wore a gray-green uniform and a helmet like the Germans. He had a healthy-looking face and a little toothbrush mustache. He looked at us. "Wave to him," I said to Catherine. She waved and the soldier smiled embarrassedly and gave a wave of his hand. I eased up rowing. We were passing the water- front of the village. "We must be well inside the border," I said. "We want to be sure, darling. We don't want them to turn us back at the frontier." "The frontier is a long way back. I think this is the customs town. I'm pretty sure it's Brissago." "Won't there be Italians there? There are always both sides at a customs town." "Not in war-time. I don't think they let the Italians cross the frontier." It was a nice-looking little town. There were many 296 A FAREWELL TO ARMS fishing boats along the quay and nets were spread on racks. There was a fine November rain falling but it looked cheerful and clean even with the rain. "Should we land then and have breakfast?" "All right." I pulled hard on the left oar and came in close, then straightened out when we were close to the quay and brought the boat alongside. I pulled in the oars, took hold of an iron ring, stepped up on the wet stone and was in Switzerland. I tied the boat and held my hand down to Catherine. "Come on up, Cat. It's a grand feeling." "What about the bags?" "Leave them in the boat." Catherine stepped up and we were in Switzerland to- gether. "What a lovely country," she said. "Isn't it grand?" "Let's go and have breakfast !" "Isn't it a grand country? I love the way it feels under my shoes." "I'm so stiff I can't feel it very well. But it feels like a splendid country. Darling, do you realize we're here and out of that bloody place?" "I do. I really do. I've never realized anything be- fore." "Look at the houses. Isn't this a fine square? There's a place we can get breakfast." "Isn't the rain fine? They never had rain like this in Italy. It's cheerful rain." "And we're here, darling! Do you realize we're here?" We went inside the cafe and sat down at a clean A FAREWELL TO ARMS 297 wooden table. We were cockeyed excited. A splendid clean-looking woman with an apron came and asked us what we wanted. "Rolls and jam and coffee," Catherine said. "I'm sorry, we haven't any rolls in war-time." "Bread then." "I can make you some toast." "All right." "I want some eggs fried too." "How many eggs for the gentleman?" "Three." "Take four, darling." "Four eggs." The woman went away. I kissed Catherine and held her hand very tight. We looked at each other and at the cafe. "Darling, darling, isn't it lovely?" "It's grand," I said. "I don't mind there not being rolls," Catherine said. "I thought about them all night. But I don't mind it. I don't mind it at all." "I suppose pretty soon they will arrest us." "Never mind, darling. We'll have breakfast first. You won't mind being arrested after breakfast. And then there's nothing they can do to us. We're British and American citizens in good standing." "You have a passport, haven't you?" "Of course. Oh let's not talk about it. Let's be happy." "I couldn't be any happier," I said. A fat gray cat with a tail that lifted like a plume crossed the floor to our table and curved against my leg to purr each time she rubbed. I reached down and stroked her. Cath- 298 A FAREWELL TO ARMS erine smiled at me very happily. "Here comes the coffee/ ' she said. They arrested us after breakfast. We took a little walk through the village then went down to the quay to get our bags. A soldier was standing guard over the boat. "Is this your boat ?" "Yes." - "Where do you come from?" "Up the lake." "Then I have to ask you to come with me." "How about the bags?" "You can carry the bags." I carried the bags and Catherine walked beside me and the soldier walked along behind us to the old cus- tom house. In the custom house a lieutenant, very thin and military, questioned us. "What nationality are you?" "American and British," "Let me see your passports." I gave him mine and Catherine got hers out of her handbag. He examined them for a long time. "Why do you enter Switzerland this way in a boat?" "I am a sportsman," I said. "Rowing is my great sport. I always row when I get a chance." "Why do you come here?" "For the winter sport. We are tourists and we want to do the winter sport." "This is no place for winter sport." "We know it. We want to go where they have the winter sport." "What have you been doing in Italy ?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 299 "I have been studying architecture. My cousin has been studying art." "Why do you leave there?" "We want to do the winter sport. With the war go- ing on you cannot study architecture." "You will please stay where you are," the lieutenant said. He went back into the building with our pass- ports. "You're splendid, darling," Catherine said. "Keep on the same track. You want to do the winter sport" "Do you know anything about art?" "Rubens," said Catherine. "Large and fat," I said. "Titian," Catherine said. "Titian-haired," I said. "How about Mantegna?" "Don't ask hard ones," Catherine said. "I know him though â€” very bitter." "Very bitter," I said. "Lots of nail holes." "You see I'll make you a fine wife," Catherine said. "I'll be able to talk art with your customers." "Here he comes," I said. The thin lieutenant came down the length of the custom house, holding our pass- ports. "I will have to send you into Locarno," he said. "You can get a carriage and a soldier will go in with you." "All right," I said. "What about the boat?" "The boat is confiscated. What have you in those bags?" He went all through the two bags and held up the quarter-bottle of brandy. "Would you join me in a drink?" I asked. "No thank you." He straightened up. "How much money have you?" 3 oo A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Twenty-five hundred lire." He was favorably impressed. "How much has your cousin ?> Catherine had a little over twelve hundred lire. The lieutenant was pleased. His attitude toward us became less haughty. "If you are going for winter sports," he said, "Wen- gen is the place. My father has a very fine hotel at Wengen. It is open all the time." "That's splendid," I said. "Could you give me the name?" "I will write it on a card." He handed me the card very politely. "The soldier will take you in to Locarno. He will keep your passports. I regret this but it is necessary. I have good hopes they will give you a visa or a police permit at Locarno." He handed the two passports to the soldier and carry- ing the bags we started into the village to order a car- riage. "Hi," the lieutenant called to the soldier. He said something in a German dialect to him. The sol- dier slung his rifle on his back and picked up the bags. "It's a great country," I said to Catherine. "It's so practical." "Thank you very much," I said to the lieutenant. He waved his hand. "Service!" he said. We followed our guard into the village. We drove to Locarno in a carriage with the soldier sitting on the front seat with the driver. At Locarno we did not have a bad time. They questioned us but they were polite because we had passports and money. I do not think they believed a word of the story and I thought it was silly but it was like a law-court. You A FAREWELL TO ARMS 301 did not want something reasonable, you wanted some- thing technical and then stuck to it without explana- tions. But we had passports and we would spend the money. So they gave us provisional visas. At any time this visa might be withdrawn. We were to report to the police wherever we went. Could we go wherever we wanted? Yes. Where did we want to go ? "Where do you want to go, Cat?" "Montreux." "It is a very nice place," the official said. "I think you will like that place." "Here at Locarno is a very nice place," another of- ficial said. "I am sure you would like it here very much at Locarno. Locarno is a very attractive place." "We would like some place where there is winter sport." "There is no winter sport at Montreux." "I beg your pardon," the other official said. "I come from Montreux. There is very certainly winter sport on the Montreux Oberland Bernois railway. It would be false for you to deny that." "I do not deny it. I simply said there is no winter sport at Montreux." "I question that," the other official said. "I question that statement." "I hold to that statement." "I question that statement. I myself have luge-ed into the streets of Montreux. I have done it not once but several times. Luge-ing is certainly winter sport." The other official turned to me. "Is luge-ing your idea of winter sport, sir? I tell you you would be very comfortable here in Locarno. You 3 o2 A FAREWELL TO ARMS would find the climate healthy, you would find the en- virons attractive. You would like it very much." "The gentleman has expressed a wish to go to Mon- treux." "What is luge-ing? ,, I asked. "You see he has never even heard of luge-ing!" That meant a great deal to the second official. He was pleased by that. "Luge-ing," said the first official, "is tobogganing." "I beg to differ," the other official shook his head. "I must differ again. The toboggan is very different from the luge. The toboggan is constructed in Canada of flat laths. The luge is a common sled with runners. Accuracy means something." "Couldn't we toboggan?" I asked. "Of course you could toboggan," the first official said. "You could toboggan very well. Excellent Cana- dian toboggans are sold in Montreux. Ochs Brothers sell toboggans. They import their own toboggans." The second official turned away. "Tobogganing," he said, "requires a special piste. You could not toboggan into the streets of Montreux. Where are you stopping here?" "We don't know," I said. "We just drove in from Brissago. The carriage is outside." "You make no mistake in going to Montreux," the first official said. "You will find the climate delightful and beautiful. You will have no distance to go for winter sport." "If you really want winter sport," the second official said, "you will go to the Engadine or to Miirren. I must protest against your being advised to go to Mon- treux for the winter sport." "At Les Avants above Montreux there is excellent A FAREWELL TO ARMS 303 winter sport of every sort." The champion of Mon- treux glared at his colleague. "Gentlemen," I said, "I am afraid we must go. My cousin is very tired. We will go tentatively to Mon- treux." "I congratulate you," the first official shook my hand. "I believe that you will regret leaving Locarno," the second official said. "At any rate you will report to the police at Montreux." "There will be no unpleasantness with the police," the first official assured me. "You will find all the in- habitants extremely courteous and friendly." "Thank you both very much," I said. "We appre- ciate your advice very much." "Good-by," Catherine said. "Thank you both very much." They bowed us to the door, the champion of Locarno a little coldly. We went down the steps and into the carriage. "My God, darling," Catherine said. "Couldn't we have gotten away any sooner?" I gave the name of a hotel one of the officials had recommended to the driver. He picked up the reins. "You've forgotten the army," Catherine said. The soldier was standing by the carriage. I gave him a ten- lira note. "I have no Swiss money yet," I said. He thanked me, saluted and went off. The carriage started and we drove to the hotel. "How did you happen to pick out Montreux?" I asked Catherine. "Do you really want to go there?" "It was the first place I could think of," she said. "It's not a bad place. We can find some place up in the mountains." "Are you sleepy?" 3 o 4 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "I'm asleep right now." "We'll get a good sleep. Poor Cat, you had a long bad night." "I had a lovely time," Catherine said. "Especially when you sailed with the umbrella." "Can you realize we're in Switzerland?" "No, I'm afraid I'll wake up and it won't be true." "I am too." "It is true, isn't it, darling? I'm not just driving down to the stazione in Milan to see you off." "I hope not." "Don't say that. It frightens me. Maybe that's where we're going." "I'm so groggy I don't know," I said. "Let me see your hands." I put them out. They were both blistered raw. "There's no hole in my side," I said. "Don't be sacrilegious." I felt very tired and vague in the head. The exhil- aration was all gone. The carriage was going along the street. "Poor hands," Catherine said. "Don't touch them," I said. "By God I don't know where we are. Where are we going, driver?" The driver stopped his horse. "To the Hotel Metropole. Don't you want to go there?" "Yes," I said. "It's all right, Cat." "It's all right, darling. Don't be upset. We'll get a good sleep and you won't feel groggy to-morrow." "I get pretty groggy," I said. "It's like a comic opera to-day. Maybe I'm hungry." "You're just tired, darling. You'll be fine." The A FAREWELL TO ARMS 305 carriage pulled up before the hotel. Some one came out to take our bags. "I feel all right," I said. We were down on the pavement going into the hotel. "I know you'll be all right. You're just tired. You've been up a long time." "Anyhow we're here." "Yes, we're really here." We followed the boy with the bags into the hotel. BOOK V CHAPTER XXXVIII That fall the snow came very late. We lived in a brown wooden house in the pine trees on the side of the mountain and at night there was frost so that there was thin ice over the water in the two pitchers on the dresser in the morning. Mrs. Guttingen came into the room early in the morning to shut the windows and started a fire in the tall porcelain stove. The pine wood crackled and sparked and then the fire roared in the stove and the second time Mrs. Guttingen came into the room she brought big chunks of wood for the fire and a pitcher of hot water. When the room was warm she brought in breakfast. Sitting up in bed eating break- fast we could see the lake and the mountains across the lake on the French side. There was snow on the tops of the mountains and the lake was a gray steel-blue. Outside, in front of the chalet a road went up the mountain. The wheel ruts and ridges were iron hard with the frost, and the road climbed steadily through the forest and up and around the mountain to where there were meadows, and barns and cabins in the meadows at the edge of the woods looking across the valley. The valley was deep and there was a stream at the bottom that flowed down into the lake and when the wind blew across the valley you could hear the stream in the rocks. Sometimes we went off the road and on a path through the pine forest. The floor of the forest was soft to walk on ; the frost did not harden it as it did the road. But we did not mind the hardness of the road because we had nails in the soles and heels of our boots 309 310 A FAREWELL TO ARMS and the heel nails bit on the frozen ruts and with nailed boots it was good walking on the road and invigorat- ing. But it was lovely walking in the woods. In front of the house where we lived the mountain went down steeply to the little plain along the lake and we sat on the porch of the house in the sun and saw the winding of the road down the mountain-side and the terraced vineyards on the side of the lower moun- tain, the vines all dead now for the winter and the fields divided by stone walls, and below the vineyards the houses of the town on the narrow plain along the lake shore. There was an island with two trees on the lake and the trees looked like the double sails of a fishing- boat. The mountains were sharp and steep on the other side of the lake and down at the end of the lake was the plain of the Rhone Valley flat between the two ranges of mountains; and up the valley where the mountains cut it off was the Dent du Midi. It was a high snowy mountain and it dominated the valley but it was so far away that it did not make a shadow. When the sun was bright we ate lunch on the porch but the rest of the time we ate upstairs in a small room with plain wooden walls and a big stcfce in the corner. We bought books and magazines in the town and a copy of "Hoyle" and learned many two-handed card games. The small room with the stove was our living- room. There were two comfortable chairs and a table for books and magazines and we played cards on the dining-table when it was cleared away. Mr. and Mrs. Guttingen lived downstairs and we would hear them talking sometimes in the evening and they were very happy together too. He had been a headwaiter and she had worked as maid in the same hotel and they had saved their money to buy this place. They had a son A FAREWELL TO ARMS 311 who was studying to be a headwaiter. He was at a hotel in Zurich. Downstairs there was a parlor where they sold wine and beer, and sometimes in the evening we would hear carts stop outside on the road and men come up the steps to go in the parlor to drink wine. There was a box of wood in the hall outside the liv- ing-room and I kept up the fire from it. But we did not stay up very late. We went to bed in the dark in the big bedroom and when I was undressed I opened the windows and saw the night and the cold stars and the pine trees below the window and then got into bed as fast as I could. It was lovely in bed with the air so cold and clear and the night outside the window. We slept well and if I woke in the night I knew it was from only one cause and I would shift the feather bed over, very softly so that Catherine would not be wakened and then go back to sleep again, warm and with the new lightness of thin covers. The war seemed as far away as the football games of some one else's college. But I knew from the papers that they were still fight- ing in the mountains because the snow would not come. Sometimes we walked down the mountain into Mon- treux. There was a path went down the mountain but it was steep and so usually we took the road and walked down on the wide hard road between fields and then below between the stone walls of the vineyards and on down between the houses of the villages along the way. There were three villages ; Chernex, Fontanivent, and the other I forget. Then along the road we passed an old square-built stone chateau on a ledge on the side of the mountain-side with the terraced fields of vines, each vine tied to a stick to hold it up, the vines dry and brown and the earth ready for the snow and the lake 3 i2 A FAREWELL TO ARMS down below flat and gray as steel. The road went down a long grade below the chateau and then turned to the right and went down very steeply and paved with cob- bles, into Montreux. We did not know any one in Montreux. We walked along beside the lake and saw the swans and the many gulls and terns that flew up when you came close and screamed while they looked down at the water. Out on the lake there were flocks of grebes, small and dark, and leaving trails in the water when they swam. In the town we walked along the main street and looked in the windows of the shops. There were many big hotels that were closed but most of the shops were open and the people were very glad to see us. There was a fine coiffeur's place where Catherine went to have her hair done. The woman who ran it was very cheerful and the only person we knew in Montreux. While Catherine was there I went up to a beer place and drank dark Munich beer and read the papers. I read the Corriere delta Sera and the English and American papers from Paris. All the advertisements were blacked out, supposedly to prevent communication in that way with the enemy. The papers were bad reading. Every- thing was going very badly everywhere. I sat back in the corner with a heavy mug of dark beer and an opened glazed-paper package of pretzels and ate the pretzels for the salty flavor and the good w r ay they made the beer taste and read about disaster. I thought Catherine would come by but she did not come, so I hung the pa- pers back on the rack, paid for my beer and went up the street to look for her. The day was cold and dark and wintry and the stone of the houses looked cold. Catherine was still in the hair-dresser's shop. The woman was waving her hair. I sat in the little booth A FAREWELL TO ARMS 313 and watched. It was exciting to watch and Catherine smiled and talked to me and my voice was a little thick from being excited. The tongs made a pleasant click- ing sound and I could see Catherine in three mirrors and it was pleasant and warm in the booth. Then the woman put up Catherine's hair, and Catherine looked in the mirror and changed it a little, taking out and putting in pins; then stood up. "I'm sorry to have taken such a long time." "Monsieur was very interested. Were you not, mon- sieur ?" the woman smiled. "Yes," I said. We went out and up the street It was cold and win- try and the wind was blowing. "Oh, darling, I love you so," I said. "Don't we have a fine time?" Catherine said. "Look. Let's go some place and have beer instead of tea. It's very good for young Catherine. It keeps her small." "Young Catherine," I said. "That loafer." "She's been very good," Catherine said. "She makes very little trouble. The doctor says beer will be good for me and keep her small." "If you keep her small enough and she's a boy, may- be he will be a jockey." "I suppose if we really have this child we ought to get married," Catherine said. We were in the beer place at the corner table. It was getting dark outside. It was still early but the day was dark and the dusk was coming early. "Let's get married now," I said. "No," Catherine said. "It's too embarrassing now. I show too plainly. I won't go before any one and be married in this state." "I wish we'd gotten married." 3H A FAREWELL TO ARMS "I suppose it would have been better. But when could we, darling ?" "I don't know." "I know one thing. I'm not going to be married in this splendid matronly state." "You're not matronly." "Oh yes, I am, darling. The hairdresser asked me if this was our first. I lied and said no, we had two boys and two girls." "When will we be married?" "Any time after I'm thin again. We want to have a splendid wedding with every one thinking what a hand- some young couple." "And you're not worried?" "Darling, why should I be worried ? The only time I ever felt badly was when I felt like a whore in Milan and that only lasted seven minutes and besides it was the room furnishings. Don't I make you a good wife?" "You're a lovely wife." "Then don't be too technical, darling. I'll marry you as soon as I'm thin again." "All right." "Do you think I ought to drink another beer? The doctor said I was rather narrow in the hips and it's all for the best if we keep young Catherine small." "What else did he say?" I was worried. "Nothing. I have a wonderful blood-pressure, dar- ling. He admired my blood-pressure greatly." "What did he say about you being too narrow in the hips?" "Nothing. Nothing at all. He said I shouldn't ski." "Quite right." "He said it was too late to start if I'd never done it A FAREWELL TO ARMS 315 before. He said I could ski if I wouldn't fall down." "He's just a big-hearted joker." "Really he was very nice. We'll have him when the baby comes." "Did you ask him if you ought to get married ?" "No. I told him we'd been married four years. You see, darling, if I marry you I'll be an American and any time we're married under American law the child is legitimate." "Where did you find that out?" "In the New York World Almanac in the library." "You're a grand girl." "I'll be very glad to be an American and we'll go to America won't we, darling? I want to see Niagara Falls." "You're a fine girl." "There's something else I want to see but I can't remember it." "The stockyards?" "No. I can't remember it." "The Woolworth building?" "No." "The Grand Canyon?" "No. But I'd like to see that." "What was it?" "The Golden Gate! That's what I want to see. Where is the Golden Gate?" "San Francisco." "Then let's go there. I want to see San Francisco anyway." "All right. We'll go there." "Now let's go up the mountain. Should we? Can we get the M. O. B. ?" "There's a train a little after five." 3 i6 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Let's get that." "All right. I'll drink one more beer first." When we went out to go up the street and climb the stairs to the station it was very cold. A cold wind was coming down the Rhone valley. There were lights in the shop windows and we climbed the steep stone stair- way to the upper street, then up another stairs to the station. The electric train was there waiting, all the lights on. There was a dial that showed when it left The clock hands pointed to ten minutes after five. I looked at the station clock. It was five minutes after. As we got on board I saw the motorman and conductor coming out of the station wine-shop. We sat down and opened the window. The train was electrically heated and stuffy but fresh cold air came in through the win- dow. "Are you tired, Cat?" I asked. "No. I feel splendid." "It isn't a long ride." "I like the ride," she said. "Don't worry about me, darling. I feel fine." Snow did not come until three days before Christ- mas. We woke one morning and it was snowing. We stayed in bed with the fire roaring in the stove and watched the snow fall. Mrs. Guttingen took away the breakfast trays and put more wood in the stove. It was a big snow storm. She said it had started about midnight. I went to the window and looked out but could not see across the road. It was blowing and snowing wildly. I went back to bed and we lay and talked. "I wish I could ski," Catherine said. "It's rotten not to be able to ski." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 317 "We'll get a bobsled and come down the road. That's no worse for you than riding in a car." "Won't it be rough?" "We can see." "I hope it won't be too rough." "After a while we'll take a walk in the snow." "Before lunch," Catherine said, "so we'll have a good appetite." "I'm always hungry." "So am I." We went out in the snow but it was drifted so that we could not walk far. I went ahead and made a trail down to the station but when we reached there we had gone far enough. The snow was blowing so we could hardly see and we went into the little inn by the station and swept each other off with a broom and sat on a bench and had vermouths. "It is a big storm," the barmaid said. "Yes." "The snow is very late this year." "Yes." "Could I eat a chocolate bar?" Catherine asked. "Or is it too close to lunch ? I'm always hungry." "Go on and eat one," I said. "I'll take one with filberts," Catherine said. "They are very good," the girl said, "I like them the best." "I'll have another vermouth," I said. When we came out to start back up the road our track was filled in by the snow. There were only faint indentations where the holes had been. The snow blew in our faces so we could hardly see. We brushed off and went in to have lunch. Mr. Guttingen served the lunch. ji8 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "To-morrow there will be skiing/' he said. "Do you ski, Mr. Henry ?" "No. But I want to learn." "You will learn very easily. My boy will be here for Christmas and he will teach you." "That's fine. When does he come?" "To-morrow night." When we were sitting by the stove in the little room after lunch looking out the window at the snow coming down Catherine said, "Wouldn't you like to go on a trip somewhere by yourself, darling, and be with men and ski?" "No. Why should I?" "I should think sometimes you would want to see other people besides me." "Do you want to see other people?" "No." "Neither do I." "I know. But you're different. I'm having a child and that makes me contented not to do anything. I know I'm awfully stupid now and I talk too much and I think you ought to get away so you won't be tired of me. "Do you want me to go away?" "No. I want you to stay." "That's what I'm going to do." "Come over here," she said. "I want to feel the bump on your head. It's a big bump." She ran her finger over it. "Darling, would you like to grow a beard?" "Would you like me to?" "It might be fun. I'd like to see you with a beard." "All right. I'll grow one. I'll start now this minute. It's a good idea. It will give me something to do." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 319 "Are you worried because you haven't anything to do?" "No. I like it. I have a fine life. Don't you?" "I have a lovely life. But I was afraid because I'm big now that maybe I was a bore to you." "Oh, Cat. You don't know how crazy I am about you." "This way?" "Just the way you are. I have a fine time. Don't we have a good life?" "I do, but I thought maybe you were restless." "No. Sometimes I wonder about the front and about people I know but I don't worry. I don't think about anything much." "Who do you wonder about?" "About Rinaldi and the priest and lots of people I know. But I don't think about them much. I don't want to think about the war. I'm through with it." "What are you thinking about now?" "Nothing." "Yes you were. Tell me." "I was wondering whether Rinaldi had the syphilis." "Was that all?" "Yes." "Has he the syphilis?" "I don't know." "I'm glad you haven't. Did you ever have anything like that?" "I had gonorrhea." "I don't want to hear about it. Was it very painful, darling?" "Very." "I wish I'd had it." 3 2o A FAREWELL TO ARMS "No you don't" "I do. I wish Fd had it to be like you. I wish Fd stayed with all your girls so I could make fun of them to you." "That's a pretty picture." "It's not a pretty picture you having gonorrhea." "I know it. Look at it snow now." "I'd rather look at you. Darling, why don't you let your hair grow?" "How grow?" "Just grow a little longer." "It's long enough now." "No, let it grow a little longer and I could cut mine and we'd be just alike only one of us blonde and one of us dark." "I wouldn't let you cut yours." "It would be fun. I'm tired of it. It's an awful nuisance in the bed at night." "I like it." "Wouldn't you like it short?" "I might. I like it the way it is." "It might be nice short. Then we'd both be alike. Oh, darling, I want you so much I want to be you too." "You are. We're the same one." "I know it. At night we are." "The nights are grand." "I want us to be all mixed up. I don't want you to go away. I just said that. You go if you want to. But hurry right back. Why, darling, I don't live at all when Fm not with you." "I won't ever go away," I said. "I'm no good when you're not there. I haven't any life at all any more." "I want you to have a life. I want you to have a fine life. But we'll have it together, won't we?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 321 "And now do you want me to stop growing my beard or let it go on?" "Go on. Grow it. It will be exciting. Maybe it will be done for New Year's." "Now do you want to play chess?" "I'd rather play with you." "No. Let's play chess." "And afterward we'll play?" "Yes." "All right." I got out the chess-board and arranged the pieces. It was still snowing hard outside. One time in the night I woke up and knew that Catherine was awake too. The moon was shining in the window and made shadows on the bed from the bars on the window-panes. "Are you awake, sweetheart?" "Yes. Can't you sleep?" "I just woke up thinking about how I was nearly crazy when I first met you. Do you remember?" "You were just a little crazy." "I'm never that way any more. I'm grand now. You say grand so sweetly. Say grand." "Grand." "Oh, you're sweet. And I'm not crazy now. I'm just very, very, very happy." "Go on to sleep," I said. "All right. Let's go to sleep at exactly the same moment." "All right." But we did not. I was awake for quite a long time thinking about things and watching Catherine sleeping, the moonlight on her face. Then I went to sleep, too. CHAPTER XXXIX By the middle of January I had a beard and the winter had settled into bright cold days and hard cold nights. We could walk on the roads again. The snow was packed hard and smooth by the hay-sleds and wood- sledges and the logs that were hauled down the moun- tain. The snow lay over all the country, down almost to Montreux. The mountains on the other side of the lake were all white and the plain of the Rhone valley was covered. We took long walks on the other side of the mountain to the Bains de l'Alliaz. Catherine wore hobnailed boots and a cape and carried a stick with a sharp steel point. She did not look big with the cape and we would not walk too fast but stopped and sat on logs by the roadside to rest when she was tired. There was an inn in the trees at the Bains de l'Alliaz where the woodcutters stopped to drink, and we sat inside warmed by the stove and drank hot red wine with spices and lemon in it. They called it gliihwein and it was a good thing to warm you and to celebrate with. The inn was dark and smoky inside and afterward when you went out the cold air came sharply into your lungs and numbed the edge of your nose as you in- haled. We looked back at the inn with light coming from the windows and the woodcutters' horses stamp- ing and jerking their heads outside to keep warm. There was frost on the hairs of their muzzles and their breathing made plumes of frost in the air. Going up the road toward home the road was smooth and slip- pery for a while and the ice orange from the horses until the wood-hauling track turned off. Then the road 322 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 323 was clean-packed snow and led through the woods, and twice coming home in the evening, we saw foxes. It was a fine country and every time that we went out it was fun. "You have a splendid beard now," Catherine said. "It looks just like the woodcutters'. Did you see the man with the tiny gold ear-rings?" "He's a chamois hunter," I said. "They wear them because they say it makes them hear better." "Really? I don't believe it. I think they wear them to show they are chamois hunters. Are there chamois near here?" "Yes, beyond the Dent de Jaman." "It was fun seeing the fox." "When he sleeps he wraps that tail around him to keep warm." "It must be a lovely feeling." "I always wanted to have a tail like that. Wouldn't it be fun if we had brushes like a fox?" "It might be very difficult dressing." "We'd have clothes made, or live in a country where it wouldn't make any difference." "We live in a country where nothing makes any dif- ference. Isn't it grand how we never see any one? You don't want to see people do you, darling?" "No." "Should we sit here just a minute? I'm a little bit tired." We sat close together on the logs. Ahead the road went down through the forest. "She won't come between us, will she? The little brat." "No. We won't let her." "How are we for money?" 324 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "We have plenty. They honored the last sight draft." "Won't your family try and get hold of you now they know you're in Switzerland?" "Probably. I'll write them something." "Haven't you written them?" "No. Only the sight draft." "Thank God I'm not your family." "I'll send them a cable." "Don't you care anything about them?" "I did, but we quarrelled so much it wore itself out." "I think I'd like them. I'd probably like them very much." "Let's not talk about them or I'll start to worry about them." After a while I said, "Let's go on if you're rested." "I'm rested." We went on down the road. It was dark now and the snow squeaked under our boots. The night was dry and cold and very clear. "I love your beard," Catherine said. "It's a great success. It looks so stiff and fierce and it's very soft and a great pleasure." "Do you like it better than without?" "I think so. You know, darling, I'm not going to cut my hair now until after young Catherine's born. I look too big and matronly now. But after she's born and I'm thin again I'm going to cut it and then I'll be a fine new and different girl for you. We'll go to- gether and get it cut, or I'll go alone and come and surprise you." I did not say anything. "You won't say I can't, will you?" "No. I think it would be exciting." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 31$ "Oh, you're so sweet. And maybe I'd look lovely, darling, and be so thin and exciting to you and you'll fall in love with me all over again/' "Hell," I said, "I love you enough now. What do you want to do? Ruin me?" "Yes. I want to ruin you." "Good," I said, "that's what I want too." CHAPTER XL We had a fine life. We lived through the months of January and February and the winter was very fine and we were very happy. There had been short thaws when the wind blew warm and the snow softened and the air felt like Spring, but always the clear hard cold had come again and the winter had returned. In March came the first break in the winter. In the night it started raining. It rained on all morning and turned the snow to slush and made the mountain-side dismal. There were clouds over the lake and over the valley. It was raining high up the mountain. Catherine wore heavy overshoes and I wore Mr. Guttingen's rubber- boots and we walked to the station under an umbrella, through the slush and the running water that was washing the ice of the roads bare, to stop at the pub before lunch for a vermouth. Outside we could hear the rain. "Do you think we ought to move into town?" "What do you think?" Catherine asked. "If the winter is over and the rain keeps up it won't be fun up here. How long is it before young Cath- erine ?" "About a month. Perhaps a little more." "We might go down and stay in Montreux." "Why don't we go to Lausanne? That's where the hospital is." "All right. But I thought maybe that was too big a town." "We can be as much alone in a bigger town and Lausanne might be nice." 326 A FAREWELL TO ARMS 327 "When should we go?" "I don't care. Whenever you want, darling. I don't want to leave here if you don't want." "Let's see how the weather turns out." It rained for three days. The snow was all gone now on the mountain-side below the station. The road was a torrent of muddy snow-water. It was too wet and slushy to go out. On the morning of the third day of rain we decided to go down into town. "That is all right, Mr. Henry," Guttingen said. "You do not have to give me any notice. I did not think you would want to stay now the bad weather is come." "We have to be near the hospital anyway on account of Madame," I said. "I understand," he said. "Will you come back some time and stay, with the little one?" "Yes, if you would have room." "In the Spring when it is nice you could come and enjoy it. We could put the little one and the nurse in the big room that is closed now and you and Madame could have your same room looking out over the lake." "I'll write about coming," I said. We packed and left on the train that went down after lunch. Mr. and Mrs. Guttingen came down to the station with us and he hauled our baggage down on a sled through the slush. They stood beside the station in the rain wav- ing good-by. "They were very sweet," Catherine said. "They were fine to us." We took the train to Lausanne from Montreux. Looking out the window toward where we had lived you could not see the mountains for the clouds. The 328 A FAREWELL TO ARMS train stopped in Vevey, then went on, passing the lake on one side and on the other the wet brown fields and the bare woods and the wet houses. We came into Lausanne and went into a medium-sized hotel to stay. It was still raining as we drove through the streets and into the carriage entrance of the hotel. The concierge with brass keys on his lapels, the elevator, the carpets on the floors, and the white washbowls with shining fixtures, the brass bed and the big comfortable bed- room all seemed very great luxury after the Guttin- gens. The windows of the room looked out on a wet garden with a wall topped by an iron fence. Across the street, which sloped steeply, was another hotel with a similar wall and garden. I looked out at the rain falling in the fountain of the garden. Catherine turned on all the lights and commenced unpacking. I ordered a whiskey and soda and lay on the bed and read the papers I had bought at the sta- tion. It was March, 191 8, and the German offensive had started in France. I drank the whiskey and soda and read while Catherine unpacked and moved around the room. "You know what I have to get, darling/' she said. "What?" "Baby clothes. There aren't many people reach my time without baby things." "You can buy them." "I know. That's what I'll do to-morrow. I'll find out what is necessary." "You ought to know. You were a nurse." "But so few of the soldiers had babies in the hos- pitals." "I did." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 329 She hit me with the pillow and spilled the whiskey and soda. "I'll order you another," she said. "I'm sorry I spilled it." "There wasn't much left. Come on over to the bed." "No. I have to try and make this room look like something." "Like what?" "Like our home." "Hang out the Allied flags." "Oh shut up." "Say it again." "Shut up." "You say it so cautiously," I said. "As though you didn't want to offend any one." "I don't." "Then come over to the bed." "All right." She came and sat on the bed. "I know I'm no fun for you, darling. I'm like a big flour-barrel." "No you're not. You're beautiful and you're sweet." "I'm just something very ungainly that you've mar- ried." "No you're not. You're more beautiful all the time." "But I will be thin again, darling." "You're thin now." "You've been drinking." "Just whiskey and soda." "There's another one coming," she said. "And then should we order dinner up here ?" "That will be good." "Then we won't go out, will we? We'll just stay in to-night." "And play," I said. "I'll drink some wine," Catherine said. "It won't 330 A FAREWELL TO ARMS hurt me. Maybe we can get some of our old white capri." "I know we can," I said. 'They'll have Italian wines at a hotel this size." The waiter knocked at the door. He brought the whiskey in a glass with ice and beside the glass on a tray a small bottle of soda. "Thank you," I said. "Put it down there. Will you please have dinner for two brought up here and two bottles of dry white capri in ice." "Do you wish to commence your dinner with soup?" "Do you want soup, Cat?" "Please." "Bring soup for one." "Thank you, sir." He went out and shut the door. I went back to the papers and the war in the papers and poured the soda slowly over the ice into the whiskey. I would have to tell them not to put ice in the whiskey. Let them bring the ice separately. That way you could tell how much whiskey there was and it would not sud- denly be too thin from the soda. I would get a bottle of whiskey and have them bring ice and soda. That was the sensible way. Good whiskey was very pleasant. It was one of the pleasant parts of life. "What are you thinking, darling?" "About whiskey." "What about whiskey?" "About how nice it is." Catherine made a face. "All right," she said. We stayed at that hotel three weeks. It was not bad; the dining-room was usually empty and very of- ten we ate in our room at night. We walked in the A FAREWELL TO ARMS 331 town and took the cogwheel railway down to Ouchy and walked beside the lake. The weather became quite warm and it was like Spring. We wished we were back in the mountains but the Spring weather lasted only a few days and then the cold rawness of the breaking-up of winter came again. Catherine bought the things she needed for the baby, up in the town. I went to a gymnasium in the arcade to box for exercise. I usually went up there in the morning while Catherine stayed late in bed. On the days of false Spring it was very nice, after boxing and taking a shower, to walk along the streets smelling the Spring in the air and stop at a cafe to sit and watch the people and read the paper and drink a vermouth; then go down to the hotel and have lunch with Cathe- rine. The professor at the boxing gymnasium wore mustaches and was very precise and jerky and went all to pieces if you started after him. But it was pleas- ant in the gym. There was good air and light and I worked quite hard, skipping rope, shadow-boxing, do- ing abdominal exercises lying on the floor in a patch of sunlight that came through the open window, and occasionally scaring the professor when we boxed. I could not shadow-box in front of the narrow long mirror at first because it looked so strange to see a man with a beard boxing. But finally I just thought it was funny. I wanted to take off the beard as soon as I started boxing but Catherine did not want me to. Sometimes Catherine and I went for rides out in the country in a carriage. It was nice to ride when the days were pleasant and we found two good places where we could ride out to eat. Catherine could not walk very far now and I loved to ride out along the country roads with her. When there was a good day 33 2 A FAREWELL TO ARMS we had a splendid time and we never had a bad time. We knew the baby was very close now and it gave us both a feeling as though something were hurrying us and we could not lose any time together. CHAPTER XLI One morning I awoke about three o'clock hearing Catherine stirring in the bed. "Are you all right, Cat?" "I've been having some pains, darling." "Regularly?" "No, not very." "If you have them at all regularly we'll go to the hospital." I was very sleepy and went back to sleep. A little while later I woke again. "Maybe you'd better call up the doctor," Catherine said. "I think maybe this is it." I went to the phone and called the doctor. "How often are the pains coming?" he asked. "How often are they coming, Cat?" "I should think every quarter of an hour." "You should go to the hospital then," the doctor said. "I will dress and go there right away myself." I hung up and called the garage near the station to send up a taxi. No one answered the phone for a long time. Then I finally got a man who promised to send up a taxi at once. Catherine was dressing. Her bag was all packed with the things she would need at the hospital and the baby things. Outside in the hall I rang for the elevator. There was no answer. I went downstairs. There was no one downstairs except the night-watchman. I brought the elevator up myself, put Catherine's bag in it, she stepped in and we went down. The night-watchman opened the door for us and we sat outside on the stone slabs beside the stairs 333 334 A FAREWELL TO ARMS down to the driveway and waited for the taxi. The night was clear and the stars were out. Catherine was very excited. "I'm so glad it's started," she said. "Now in a little while it will be all over." "You're a good brave girl." "I'm not afraid. I wish the taxi would come, though." We heard it coming up the street and saw its head- lights. It turned into the driveway and I helped Catherine in and the driver put the bag up in front. "Drive to the hospital," I said. We went out of the driveway and started up the hill. At the hospital we went in and I carried the bag. There was a woman at the desk who wrote down Catherine's name, age, address, relatives and religion, in a book. She said she had no religion and the wo- man drew a line in the space after that word. She gave her name as Catherine Henry. "I will take you up to your room," she said. We went up in an elevator. The woman stopped it and we stepped out and followed her down a hall. Catherine held tight to my arm. "This is the room," the woman said. "Will you please undress and get into bed ? Here is a nightgown for you to wear." "I have a nightgown," Catherine said. "It is better for you to wear this nightgown," the woman said. I went outside and sat on a chair in the hallway. "You can come in now," the woman said from the doorway. Catherine was lying in the narrow bed wear- ing a plain, square-cut nightgown that looked as though it were made of rough sheeting. She smiled at me. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 335 "I'm having fine pains now," she said. The woman was holding her wrist and timing the pains with a watch. "That was a big one," Catherine said. I saw it on her face. "Where's the doctor?" I asked the woman. "He's lying down sleeping. He will be here when he is needed." "I must do something for Madame, now," the nurse said. "Would you please step out again?" I went out into the hall. It was a bare hall with two windows and closed doors all down the corridor. It smelled of hospital. I sat on the chair and looked at the floor and prayed for Catherine. "You can come in," the nurse said. I went in. "Hello, darling," Catherine said. "How is it?" "They are coming quite often now." Her face drew up. Then she smiled. "That was a real one. Do you want to put your hand on my back again, nurse?" "If it helps you," the nurse said. "You go away, darling," Catherine said. "Go out and get something to eat. I may do this for a long time the nurse says." "The first labor is usually protracted," the nurse said. "Please go out and get something to eat," Catherine said. "I'm fine, really." "I'll stay awhile," I said. The pains came quite regularly, then slackened off. Catherine was very excited. When the pains were bad she called them good ones. When they started to fall off she was disappointed and ashamed. 336 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "You go out, darling," she said. "I think you are just making me self-conscious." Her face tied up. "There. That was better. I so want to be a good wife and have this child without any foolishness. Please go and get some breakfast, darling, and then come back. I won't miss you. Nurse is splendid to me." "You have plenty of time for breakfast," the nurse said- "I'll go then. Good-by, sweet." "Good-by," Catherine said, "and have a fine break- fast for me too." "Where can I get breakfast?" I asked the nurse. "There's a cafe down the street at the square," she said. "It should be open now." Outside it was getting light. I walked down the empty street to the cafe. There was a light in the win- dow. I went in and stood at the zinc bar and an old man served me a glass of white wine and a brioche. The brioche was yesterday's. I dipped it in the wine and then drank a glass of coffee. "What do you do at this hour?" the old man asked. "My wife is in labor at the hospital." "So. I wish you good luck." "Give me another glass of wine." He poured it from the bottle slopping it over a little so some ran down on the zinc. I drank this glass, paid and went out. Outside along the street were the refuse cans from the houses waiting for the collector. A dog was nosing at one of the cans. "What do you want?" I asked and looked in the can to see if there was anything I could pull out for him; there was nothing on top but coffee-grounds, dust and some dead flowers. "There isn't anything, dog," I said. The dog crossed A FAREWELL TO ARMS 337 the street. I went up the stairs in the hospital to the floor Catherine was on and down the hall to her room. I knocked on the door. There was no answer. I opened the door; the room was empty, except for Catherine's bag on a chair and her dressing-gown hanging on a hook on the wall I went out and down the hall, look- ing for somebody. I found a nurse. "Where is Madame Henry ?" "A lady has just gone to the delivery room." "Where is it?" "I will show you." She took me down to the end of the hall. The door of the room was partly open. I could see Catherine lying on a table, covered by a sheet. The nurse was on one side and the doctor stood on the other side of the table beside some cylinders. The doctor held a rubber mask attached to a tube in one hand. "I will give you a gown and you can go in," the nurse said. "Come in here, please." She put a white gown on me and pinned it at the neck in back with a safety pin. "Now you can go in," she said. I went into the room. "Hello, darling," Catherine said in a strained voice. "I'm not doing much." "You are Mr. Henry?" the doctor asked. "Yes. How is everything going, doctor?" "Things are going very well," the doctor said. "We came in here where it is easy to give gas for the pains." "I want it now," Catherine said. The doctor placed the rubber mask over her face and turned a dial and I watched Catherine breathing deeply and rapidly. Then she pushed the mask away. The doctor shut off the petcock. "That wasn't a very big one. I had a very big one 338 A FAREWELL TO ARMS a while ago. The doctor made me go clear out, didn't you, doctor ?" Her voice was strange. It rose on the word doctor. The doctor smiled. "I want it again," Catherine said. She held the rub- ber tight to her face and breathed fast. I heard her moaning a little. Then she pulled the mask away and smiled. "That was a big one," she said. "That was a very big one. Don't you worry, darling. You go away. Go have another breakfast." "I'D stay," I said. We had gone to the hospital about three o'clock in the morning. At noon Catherine was still in the delivery room. The pains had slackened again. She looked very tired and worn now but she was still cheerful. "I'm not any good, darling," she said. "I'm so sorry. I thought I would do it very easily. Now â€” there's one â€” " she reached out her hand for the mask and held it over her face. The doctor moved the dial and watched her. In a little while it was over. "It wasn't much," Catherine said. She smiled. "I'm a fool about the gas. It's wonderful." "We'll get some for the home," I said. "There one comes" Catherine said quickly. The doc- tor turned the dial and looked at his watch. "What is the interval now?" I asked. "About a minute." "Don't you want lunch?" "I will have something pretty soon," he said. "You must have something to eat, doctor," Cathe- rine said. "I'm so sorry I go on so long. Couldn't my husband give me the gas?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 339 "If you wish," the doctor said. "You turn it to the numeral two." "I see," I said. There was a marker on a dial that turned with a handle. "1 want it now/' Catherine said. She held the mask tight to her face. I turned the dial to number two and when Catherine put down the mask I turned it off. It was very good of the doctor to let me do something. "Did you do it, darling?" Catherine asked. She stroked my wrist. "Sure." "You're so lovely." She was a little drunk from the gas. "I will eat from a tray in the next room," the doc- tor said. "You can call me any moment." While the time passed I watched him eat, then, after a while, I saw that he was lying down and smoking, a cigarette. Catherine was getting very tired. "Do you think I'll ever have this baby?" she asked. "Yes, of course you will." "I try as hard as I can. I push down but it goes away. There it comes. Give it to me." At two o'clock I went out and had lunch. There were a few men in the cafe sitting with coffee and glasses of kirsch or marc on the tables. I sat down at a table. "Can I eat?" I asked the waiter. "It is past time for lunch." "Isn't there anything for all hours?" "You can have choucroute!' "Give me choucroute and beer." "A demi or a bock?" "A light demi." The waiter brought a dish of sauerkraut with a slice 34 o A FAREWELL TO ARMS of ham over the top and a sausage buried in the hot wine-soaked cabbage. I ate it and drank the beer. I was very hungry. I watched the people at the tables in the cafe. At one table they were playing cards. Two men at the table next me were talking and smoking. The cafe was full of smoke. The zinc bar, where I had breakfasted, had three people behind it now; the old man, a plump woman in a black dress who sat behind a counter and kept track of everything served to the tables, and a boy in an apron. I wondered how many children the woman had and what it had been like. When I was through with the choucroute I went back to the hospital. The street was all clean now. There were no refuse cans out. The day was cloudy but the sun was trying to come through. I rode up- stairs in the elevator, stepped out and went down the hall to Catherine's room, where I had left my white gown. I put it on and pinned it in back at the neck. I looked in the glass and saw myself looking like a fake doctor with a beard. I went down the hall to the de- livery room. The door was closed and I knocked. No one answered so I turned the handle and went in. The doctor sat by Catherine. The nurse was doing some- thing at the other end of the room. "Here is your husband," the doctor said. "Oh, darling, I have the most wonderful doctor," Catherine said in a very strange voice. "He's been telling me the most wonderful story and when the pain came too badly he put me all the way out. He's won- derful. You're wonderful, doctor." "You're drunk," I said. "I know it," Catherine said. "But you shouldn't say it." Then "Give it to me. Give it to me/' She clutched hold of the mask and breathed short and deep, A FAREWELL TO ARMS 341 pantingly, making the respirator click. Then she gave a long sigh and the doctor reached with his left hand and lifted away the mask. "That was a very big one," Catherine said. Her voice was very strange. "I'm not going to die now, darling. I'm past where I was going to die. Aren't you glad?" "Don't you get in that place again." "I won't. I'm not afraid of it though. I won't die, darling." "You will not do any such foolishness," the doctor said. "You would not die and leave your husband." "Oh, no. I won't die. I wouldn't die. It's silly to die. There it comes. Give it to me." After a while the doctor said, "You will go out, Mr. Henry, for a few moments and I will make an ex- amination." "He wants to see how I am doing," Catherine said. "You can come back afterward, darling, can't he, doc- tor?" "Yes," said the doctor. "I will send word when he can come back." I went out the door and down the hall to the room where Catherine was to be after the baby came. I sat in a chair there ana looked at the room. I had the paper in my coat that I had bought when I went out for lunch and I read it. It was beginning to be dark outside and I turned the light on to read. After a while I stopped reading and turned off the light and watched it get dark outside. I wondered why the doctor did not send for me. Maybe it was better I was away. He probably wanted me away for a while. I looked at my watch. If he did not send for me in ten minutes I would go down anyway. Poor, poor dear Cat. And this was the price you 342 A FAREWELL TO ARMS paid for sleeping together. This was the end of the trap. This was what people got for loving each other. Thank God for gas, anyway. What must it have been like before there were anaesthetics? Once it started, they were in the mill-race. Catherine had a good time in the time of pregnancy. It wasn't bad. She was hardly ever sick. She was not awfully uncomfortable until toward the last. So now they got her in the end. You never got away with anything. Get away hell! It would have been the same if we had been married fifty times. And what if she should die? She won't die. People don't die in childbirth nowadays. That was what all husbands thought. Yes, but what if she should die? She won't die. She's just having a bad time. The initial labor is usually protracted. She's only having a bad time. Afterward we'd say what a bad time and Catherine would say it wasn't really so bad. But what if she should die? She can't die. Yes, but what if she should die? She can't, I tell you. Don't be a fool. It's just a bad time. It's just nature giv- ing her hell. It's only the first labor, which is almost always protracted. Yes, but what if she should die? She can't die. Why would she die? What reason is there for her to die? There's just a child that has to be born, the by-product of good nights in Milan. It makes trouble and is born and then you look after it and get fond of it maybe. But what if she should die? She won't die. But what if she should die? She won't. She's all right. But what if she should die? She can't die. But what if she should die? Hey, what about that? What if she should die? The doctor came into the room. "How does it go, doctor?" "It doesn't go," he said. A FAREWELL TO ARMS 343 "What do you mean?" "Just that. I made an examination â€” " He detailed the result of the examination. "Since then I've waited to see. But it doesn't go." "What do you advise?" "There are two things. Either a high forceps de- livery which can tear and be quite dangerous besides being possibly bad for the child, and a Caesarean." "What is the danger of a Caesarean?" What if she should die ! "It should be no greater than the danger of an or- dinary delivery." "Would you do it yourself?" "Yes. I would need possibly an hour to get things ready and to get the people I would need. Perhaps a little less." "What do you think?" "I would advise a Caesarean operation. If it were my wife I would do a Caesarean." "What are the after effects?" "There are none. There is only the scar." "What about infection?" â–  "The danger is not so great as in a high forceps de- livery." "What if you just went on and did nothing?" "You would have to do something eventually. Mrs. Henry is already losing much of her strength. The sooner we operate now the safer." "Operate as soon as you can," I said. "I will go and give the instructions." I went into the delivery room. The nurse was with Catherine who lay on the table, big under the sheet, looking very pale and tired. "Did you tell him he could do it?" she asked. 344 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Yes." "Isn't that grand. Now it will be all over in an hour. I'm almost done, darling. I'm going all to pieces. Please give me that. It doesn't work. Oh, it doesn't work!" "Breathe deeply." "I am. Oh, it doesn't work any more. It doesn't work!" "Get another cylinder," I said to the nurse. "That is a new cylinder." "I'm just a fool, darling," Catherine said. "But it doesn't work any more." She began to cry. "Oh, I wanted so to have this baby and not make trouble, and now I'm all done and all gone to pieces and it doesn't work. Oh, darling, it doesn't work at all. I don't care if I die if it will only stop. Oh, please, darling, please make it stop. There it comes. Oh Oh Oh!" She breathed sobbingly in the mask. "It doesn't work. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. Don't mind me, darling. Please don't cry. Don't mind me. I'm just gone all to pieces. You poor sweet. I love you so and I'll be good again. I'll be good this time. Can't they give me something? If they could only give me some- thing." "I'll make it work. I'll turn it all the way." "Give it to me now." I turned the dial all the way and as she breathed hard and deep her hand relaxed on the mask. I shut off the gas and lifted the mask. She came back from a long way away. "That was lovely, darling. Oh, you're so good to me. "You be brave, because I can't do that all the time. It might kill you." A FAREWELL TO ARMS 345 "I'm not brave any more, darling. I'm all broken. They've broken me. I know it now." " Everybody is that way." "But it's awful. They just keep it up till they break you." "In an hour it will be over." "Isn't that lovely? Darling, I won't die, will I?" "No. I promise you won't." "Because I don't want to die and leave you, but I get so tired of it and I feel I'm going to die." "Nonsense. Everybody feels that." "Sometimes I know I'm going to die." "You won't. You can't." "But what if I should?" "I won't let you." "Give it to me quick. Give it to meT Then afterward, "I won't die. I won't let myself die." "Of course you won't." "You'll stay with me?" "Not to watch it." "No, just to be there." "Sure. I'll be there all the time." "You're so good to me. There, give it to me. Give me some more. It's not working 7" I turned the dial to three and then four. I wished the doctor would come back. I was afraid of the num- bers above two. Finally a new doctor came in with two nurses and they lifted Catherine onto a wheeled stretcher and we started down the hall. The stretcher went rapidly down the hall and into the elevator where every one had to crowd against the wall to make room; then up, then 34 6 A FAREWELL TO ARMS an open door and out of the elevator and down the hall on rubber wheels to the operating room. I did not recognize the doctor with his cap and mask on. There was another doctor and more nurses. "They've got to give me something/' Catherine said. "They've got to give me something. Oh please, doc- tor, give me enough to do some good !" One of the doctors put a mask over her face and I looked through the door and saw the bright small am- phitheatre of the operating room. "You can go in the other door and sit up there," a nurse said to me. There were benches behind a rail that looked down on the white table and the lights. I looked at Catherine. The mask was over her face and she was quiet now. They wheeled the stretcher for- ward. I turned away and walked down the hall. Two nurses were hurrying toward the entrance to the gal- lery. "It's a Caesarean," one said. "They're going to do a Caesarean." The other one laughed, "We're just in time. Aren't we lucky?" They went in the door that led to the gallery. Another nurse came along. She was hurrying too. "You go right in there. Go right in," she said. "I'm staying outside." She hurried in. I walked up and down the hall. I was afraid to go in. I looked out the window. It was dark but in the light from the window I could see it was raining. I went into a room at the far end of the hall and looked at the labels on bottles in a glass case. Then I came out and stood in the empty hall and watched the door of the operating room. A doctor came out followed by a nurse. He held A FAREWELL TO ARMS 347 something in his two hands that looked like a freshly skinned rabbit and hurried across the corridor with it and in through another door. I went down to the door he had gone into and found them in the room doing things to a new-born child. The doctor held him up for me to see. He held him by the heels and slapped him. "Is he all right ?" "He's magnificent. He'll weigh five kilos." I had no feeling for him. He did not seem to have anything to do with me. I felt no feeling of father- hood. "Aren't you proud of your son?" the nurse asked. They were washing him and wrapping him in some- thing. I saw the little dark face and dark hand, but I did not see him move or hear him cry. The doctor was doing something to him again. He looked upset. "No," I said. "He nearly killed his mother." "It isn't the little darling's fault. Didn't you want a boy?" "No," I said. The doctor was busy with him. He held him up by the feet and slapped him. I did not wait to see it. I went out in the hall. I could go in now and see. I went in the door and a little way down the gallery. The nurses who were sitting at the rail motioned for me to come down where they were. I shook my head. I could see enough where I was. I thought Catherine was dead. She looked dead. Her face was gray, the part of it that I could see. Down below, under the light, the doctor was sewing up the great long, forcep-spread, thick-edged, wound. Another doctor in a mask gave the anaesthetic. Two nurses in masks handed things. It looked like a draw- ing of the Inquisition. I knew as I watched I could have watched it all, but I was glad I hadn't. I do not 348 A FAREWELL TO ARMS think I could have watched them cut, but I watched the wound closed into a high welted ridge with quick skil- ful-looking stitches like a cobbler's, and was glad. When the wound was closed I went out into the hall and walked up and down again. After a while the doctor came out. "How is she?" "She is all right. Did you watch?" He looked tired. "I saw you sew up. The incision looked very long." "You thought so?" "Yes. Will that scar flatten out?" "Oh, yes." After a while they brought out the wheeled stretcher and took it very rapidly down the hallway to the ele- vator. I went along beside it. Catherine was moan- ing. Downstairs they put her in the bed in her room. I sat in a chair at the foot of the bed. There was a nurse in the room. I got up and stood by the bed. It was dark in the room. Catherine put out her hand, "Hello, darling," she said. Her voice was very weak and tired. "Hello, you sweet." "What sort of baby was it?" "Sh â€” don't talk," the nurse said. "A boy. He's long and wide and dark." "Is he all right?" "Yes," I said. "He's fine." I saw the nurse look at me strangely. "I'm awfully tired," Catherine said. "And I hurt like hell. Are you all right, darling?" "I'm fine. Don't talk." "You were lovely to me. Oh, darling, I hurt dread- fully. What does he look like?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 349 "He looks like a skinned rabbit with a puckered-up old-man's face." "You must go out," the nurse said. "Madame Henry must not talk." 'Til be outside," I said. "Go and get something to eat" "No. I'll be outside." I kissed Catherine. She was very gray and weak and tired. "May I speak to you?" I said to the nurse. She came out in the hall with me. I walked a little way down the hall. "What's the matter with the baby?" I asked. "Didn't you know?" "No." "He wasn't alive." "He was dead?" "They couldn't start him breathing. The cord was caught around his neck or something." "So he's dead." "Yes. It's such a shame. He was such a fine big boy. I thought you knew." "No," I said. "You better go back in with Ma- dame." I sat down on the chair in front of a table where there were nurses' reports hung on clips at the side and looked out of the window. I could see nothing but the dark and the rain falling across the light from the window. So that was it. The baby was dead. That was why the doctor looked so tired. But why had they acted the way they did in the room with him? They supposed he would come around and start breathing probably. I had no religion but I knew he ought to have been baptized. But what if he never breathed at 350 A FAREWELL TO ARMS all. He hadn't. He had never been alive. Except in Catherine. I'd felt him kick there often enough. But I hadn't for a week. Maybe he was choked all the time. Poor little kid. I wished the hell I'd been choked like that. No I didn't. Still there would not be all this dying to go through. Now Catherine would die. That was what you did. You died. You did not know what it was about. You never had time to learn. They threw you in and told you the rules and the first time they caught you off base they killed you. Or they killed you gratuitously like Aymo. Or gave you the syphi- lis like Rinaldo. But they killed you in the end. You could count on that. Stay around and they would kill you. Once in camp I put a log on top of the fire and it was full of ants. As it commenced to burn, the ants swarmed out and went first toward the centre where the fire was ; then turned back and ran toward the end. When there were enough on the end they fell off into the fire. Some got out, their bodies burnt and flattened, and went off not knowing where they were going. But most of them went toward the fire and then back to- ward the end and swarmed on the cool end and finally fell off into the fire. I remember thinking at the time that it was the end of the world and a splendid chance to be a messiah and lift the log off the fire and throw it out where the ants could get off onto the ground. But I did not do anything but throw a tin cup of water on the log, so that I would have the cup empty to put whiskey in before I added water to it. I think the cup of water on the burning log only steamed the ants. So now I sat out in the hall and waited to hear how Catherine was. The nurse did not come out, so after a while I went to the door and opened it very softly and A FAREWELL TO ARMS 351 looked in. I could not see at first because there was a bright light in the hall and it was dark in the room. Then I saw the nurse sitting by the bed and Cathe- rine's head on a pillow, and she all flat under the sheet. The nurse put her finger to her lips, then stood up and came to the door. "How is she?" I asked. "She's all right," the nurse said. "You should go and have your supper and then come back if you wish." I went down the hall and then down the stairs and out the door of the hospital and down the dark street in the rain to the cafe. It was brightly lighted inside and there were many people at the tables. I did not see a place to sit, and a waiter came up to me and took my wet coat and hat and showed me a place at a table across from an elderly man who was drinking beer and reading the evening paper. I sat down and asked the waiter what the plat du jour was. "Veal stew â€” but it is finished." "What can I have to eat?" "Ham and eggs, eggs with cheese, or choucroute" "I had choucroute this noon," I said. "That's true," he said. "That's true. You ate chou- croute this noon." He was a middle-aged man with a bald top to his head and his hair slicked over it. He had a kind face. "What do you want? Ham and eggs or eggs with cheese?" "Ham and eggs," I said, "and beer." "A demi-blonde?" "Yes," I said. "I remembered," he said. "You took a demi-blonde this noon." I ate the ham and eggs and drank the beer. The ham 352 A FAREWELL TO ARMS and eggs were in a round dish â€” the ham underneath and the eggs on top. It was very hot and at the first mouthful I had to take a drink of beer to cool my mouth. I was hungry and I asked the waiter for an- other order. I drank several glasses of beer. I was not thinking at all but read the paper of the man op- posite me. It was about the break through on the Brit- ish front. When he realized I was reading the back of his paper he folded it over. I thought of asking the waiter for a paper, but I could not concentrate. It was hot in the cafe and the air was bad. Many of the people at the tables knew one another. There were sev- eral card games going on. The waiters were busy bringing drinks from the bar to the tables. Two men came in and could find no place to sit. They stood op- posite the table where I was. I ordered another beer. I was not ready to leave yet. It was too soon to go back to the hospital. I tried not to think and to be perfectly calm. The men stood around but no one was leaving, so they went out. I drank another beer. There was quite a pile of saucers now on the table in front of me. The man opposite me had taken off his spectacles, put them away in a case, folded his paper and put it in his pocket and now sat holding his liqueur glass and looking out at the room. Suddenly I knew I had to get back. I called the waiter, paid the reckoning, got into my coat, put on my hat and started out the door. I walked through the rain up to the hospital. Upstairs I met the nurse coming down the hall. "I just called you at the hotel," she said. Some- thing dropped inside me. "What is wrong?" "Mrs. Henry has had a hemorrhage." "Can I go in?" A FAREWELL TO ARMS 353 "No, not yet. The doctor is with her." "Is it dangerous?" "It is very dangerous." The nurse went into the room and shut the door. I sat outside in the hall. Everything was gone inside of me. I did not think. I could not think. I knew she was going to die and I prayed that she would not. Don't let her die. Oh, God, please don't let her die. I'll do anything for you if you won't let her die. Please, please, please, dear God, don't let her die. Dear God, don't let her die. Please, please, please don't let her die. God please make her not die. I'll do anything you say if you don't let her die. You took the baby but don't let her die. That was all right but don't let her die. Please, please, dear God, don't let her die. The nurse opened the door and motioned with her finger for me to come. I followed her into the room. Catherine did not look up when I came in. I went over to the side of the bed. The doctor was standing by the bed on the opposite side. Catherine looked at me and smiled. I bent down over the bed and started to cry. "Poor darling," Catherine said very softly. She looked gray. "You're all right, Cat," I said. "You're going to be all right." "I'm going to die," she said; then waited and said, "I hate it." I took her hand. "Don't touch me," she said. I let go of her hand. She smiled. "Poor darling. You touch me all you want." "You'll be all right, Cat. I know you'll be all right." "I meant to write you a letter to have if anything happened, but I didn't do it." 354 A FAREWELL TO ARMS "Do you want me to get a priest or any one to come and see you?" "Just you," she said. Then a little later, "I'm not afraid. I just hate it." "You must not talk so much," the doctor said. "All right," Catherine said. "Do you want me to do anything, Cat? Can I get you anything?" Catherine smiled, "No." Then a little later, "You won't do our things with another girl, or say the same things, will you?" "Never." "I want you to have girls, though." "I don't want them." "You are talking too much," the doctor said. "Mr. Henry must go out. He can come back again later. You are not going to die. You must not be silly." "All right," Catherine said. "I'll come and stay with you nights," she said. It was very hard for her to talk. "Please go out of the room," the doctor said. "You cannot talk." Catherine winked at me, her face gray. "I'll be right outside," I said. "Don't worry, darling," Catherine said. "I'm not a bit afraid. It's just a dirty trick." "You dear, brave sweet." I waited outside in the hall. I waited a long time. The nurse came to the door and came over to me. "I'm afraid Mrs. Henry is very ill," she said. "I'm afraid for her." "Is she dead?" "No, but she is unconscious." It seems she had one hemorrhage after another. They couldn't stop it. I went into the room and stayed A FAREWELL TO ARMS 355 with Catherine until she died. She was unconscious all the time, and it did not take her very long to die. Outside the room, in the hall, I spoke to the doctor, "is there anything I can do to-night ?" "No. There is nothing to do. Can I take you to your hotel?" "No, thank you. I am going to stay here a while.' ' "I know there is nothing to say. I cannot tell you " "No," I said. "There's nothing to say." "Good-night," he said. "I cannot take you to your hotel?" "No, thank you." "It was the only thing to do," he said. "The opera- tion proved " "I do not want to talk about it," I said. "I would like to take you to your hotel." "No, thank you." He went down the hall. I went to the door of the room. "You can't come in now," one of the nurses said. "Yes I can," I said. "You can't come in yet." "You get out," I said. "The other one too." But after I had got them out and shut the door and turned off the light it wasn't any good. It was like say- ing good-by to a statue. After a while I went out and left the hospital and walked back to the hotel in the rain. Chapter one He lay flat on the brown floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees. Below he could see the dark of the road going through the pass. There was a stream alongside the road and far down the pass he saw a mill beside the stream. "Is that the mill?" he asked. "Yes." He spread out the military map and looked at it carefully. The old man looked over his shoulder. He was a short and solid old man in a black peasant's smock and gray trousers and he wore rope-soled shoes. He was breathing heavily from the climb and his hand rested on one of the two heavy packs they had been carrying. "Then you cannot see the bridge from here." "No," the old man said. The young man took his binoculars from the pocket of his khaki flannel shirt and looked at the mill. "There is no sentry." "There is smoke coming from the millhouse," the old man said. "I see it but I do not see any sentry." "Perhaps he is in the shade," the old man explained. "It is hot there now." "Probably. Where is the next post?" "Below the bridge." "How many men are here?" He pointed at the mill. "Perhaps five." "And below?" "More. I will find out." "And at the bridge?" "Always two. One at each end." "We will need a certain number of men," he said. "Do you wish to study it now?" "No. Now I wish to go to where we will hide this explosive until it is time. I would like to have it hidden in utmost security at a distance no greater than half an hour from the bridge, if that is possible." "That is simple," the old man said. "But now we must climb a little to get there. Are you hungry?" "Yes," the young man said. "But we will eat later. How are you called? I have forgotten." It was a bad sign to him that he had forgotten. "I am called Anselmo," the old man said. The young man, who was tall and thin, with fair hair and a wind-and sunburned face, wore a flannel shirt, a pair of peasant's trousers and rope-soled shoes. He leaned over and put the heavy pack onto his shoulders. "I'm ready," he said. "How do we go?" "We climb," Anselmo said. Bending under the weight of the packs, sweating, they climbed steadily in the pine forest that covered the mountainside. "Wait here, Roberto," said Anselmo. Robert Jordan trusted Anselmo so far, in everything except judgment. He had not yet had an opportunity to test his judgment, and, anyway, the judgment was his own responsibility. No, he did not worry about Anselmo and the problem of the bridge was no more difficult than many other problems. He knew how to blow up any sort of bridge and he had blown them of all sizes and constructions. He must not worry. To worry was as bad as to be afraid. It simply made things more difficult. Pushing himself up on his hands he saw the old man coming down the mountainside. With him was another man, also in a black peasant smock and the dark gray trousers that were almost a uniform in that province, wearing rope-soled shoes and with a carbine on his back. The two of them came down the rock like goats. "Salud, Camarada," he said to the man with the carbine and smiled. "Salud," the other said. Robert Jordan looked at the man's round, beard-stubbled face. He was a heavy man about five feet ten inches tall and his hands and feet were large. His nose had been broken and his mouth was cut at one corner and the line of the scar showed through the growth of beard over his face. The old man nodded his head at this man and smiled. "He is the boss here," he said. "A very strong man." "I can see it," Robert Jordan said and smiled again. He did not like the look of this man and inside himself he was not smiling at all. "What have you to justify your identity?" asked the man with the carbine. Robert took a folded paper out of the left breast pocket of his shirt and handed it to the man, who opened it, looked at it doubtfully and turned it in his hands. So he cannot read, Robert Jordan noted. "Look at the seal," he said. "Yes, I have seen that seal before. What have you in the packs?" "Dynamite," the old man said proudly. "I can use dynamite," said the man with the carbine. He handed back the paper to Robert Jordan and looked him over. "How much have you brought me?" "I have brought you no dynamite," Robert Jordan said. "The dynamite is for another purpose. What is your name?" "Why?" "He is Pablo," said the old man. The man with the carbine looked at them both sullenly. "I have heard many good things about you," said Robert Jordan. "I have heard that you are an excellent guerilla leader, that you are loyal to the Republic and prove your loyalty through your acts, and that you are serious and valiant." "What are you going to do with the dynamite?" "Blow up a bridge." "What bridge?" "That is my business." "If it is in this territory, it is my business." "This is my business," Robert Jordan said. "We can discuss it together. Now let us go." There was a sadness in Pablo that worried him, the sadness that comes before the sell-out. They began climbing and reached an open space in the forest. Ahead of them horses whinnied in the forest. Robert Jordan knew he had to admire the horses. "Yes," he said. "They are beautiful." He turned to Pablo. "You have your cavalry and all." There were five horses and now Pablo was proud and less sad-looking, watching them lovingly. "All these I have taken," Pablo said and Robert Jordan was pleased to hear him speak proudly. "Here I am with horses like these. And what can I look forward to? To be hunted and to die. Nothing more. I am tired of being hunted. Here we are all right. Now if you blow up a bridge here, we will be hunted and they will find us. I am tired of all this. You hear?" He turned to Robert Jordan. "What right have you, a foreigner, to come and tell me what I must do?" "I have not told you anything you must do," Robert Jordan said to him. "You will though," Pablo said. "I come only for my duty," Robert Jordan told him. "I come under orders from those who are conducting the war. If I ask you to help me, you can refuse and I will find others who will help me. That I am a foreigner is not my fault." "To me, now, it is most important that we are not disturbed here," Pablo said. "My duty is to those who are with me and to myself." "Yes," Anselmo said. "Yourself and your horses. When you did not have the horses, you were with us. Now you are another capitalist." "That is unjust," said Pablo. "I expose the horses all the time for the cause." "Very little," said Anselmo scornfully. "To steal, yes. To eat well, yes. To murder, yes. To fight, no." "You are an old man who will make trouble for himself with his mouth." "I am an old man who is afraid of no one," Anselmo told him. "You are an old man who may not live long." "I am an old man who will live until I die," Anselmo said. It is starting badly enough, Robert Jordan thought. But Anselmo's a man. They are wonderful when they are good, he thought, and when they go bad there is no people that is worse. I don't like any of this. chapter TWO They had come through the forest and reached the camp. There was a large cave and beside the opening a man sat with his back against the rock. "Hola," said the seated man. "What is this that comes?" "The old man and a dynamiter," Pablo told him and lowered the pack inside the entrance to the cave. "Don't leave it so close to the cave," said a man who had blue eyes in a dark, good-looking lazy gypsy face. "There's a fire in there." "He's Rafael, a gypsy," Anselmo said. "Gypsies talk much and kill little." The gypsy smiled at Robert Jordan. Anselmo said, "I'm going to get some wine." Robert Jordan lifted the sacks from the cave entrance and leaned them, one on each side of a tree trunk. He knew what was in them and never liked to see them close together. "Here is the wine." Anselmo said. It was good, light and clean on the tongue. "The food comes soon," Pablo said. A girl came out of the cave carrying a big iron cooking platter and Robert Jordan saw her face and the strange thing about her. She smiled and said, "Hola, Comrade," and Robert Jordan said, "Salud." She set down the flat iron platter with meat in front of him and he noticed her handsome brown hands. Now she looked him full in the face and smiled. Her teeth were white in her brown face and her skin and her eyes were the same golden tawny brown. She had high cheekbones, happy eyes and a straight mouth with full lips. Her hair was golden but it was cut short all over her head. She smiled in Robert Jordan's face and put her brown hand up and ran it over her head, flattening the hair which rose again as her hand passed. She has a beautiful face, Robert Jordan thought. She'd be beautiful if they hadn't cropped her hair. "That is the way I comb it," she said and laughed. "Go ahead and eat. They gave me this haircut in Valladolid." She sat down opposite him. She had long legs, and he could see the shape of her small breasts under the gray shirt. Every time Robert Jordan looked at her he could feel a thickness in his throat. "How are you called?" he asked. "Maria. And you?" "Roberto. Have you been long in the mountains?" "Three months." She passed her hand over her hair in embarrassment. "It was shaved," she said. "They shaved it regularly in the prison at Valladolid. I was on the train. They were taking me to the south. Many of the prisoners were caught after the train was blown up but I was not." "I found her hidden in the rocks," the gypsy said. "We took her with us." "You have a very beautiful face," he said to Maria. "I wish I would have had the luck to see you before your hair was cut." "It will grow out," she said. "In six months it will be long enough." Robert Jordan turned to Anselmo and asked, "How many are you?" "We are seven and there are two women." "Two?" "Yes. The mujer of Pablo." "And she?" "In the cave. The girl can cook a little, but mostly she helps the mujer of Pablo." "And how is the mujer of Pablo?" "Something barbarous," the gypsy grinned. "If you think Pablo is ugly you should see his woman. But brave. A hundred times braver than Pablo." "Pablo was brave in the beginning," Anselmo said. "Pablo was something serious in the beginning. Now he is very much afraid to die." Robert Jordan lay back on the floor of the forest and looked at the high Spanish sky. "Can you read in the palm of the hand?" the gypsy asked. "No," Robert Jordan said. "But if you can I wish you would read in the palm of my hand and tell me what is going to pass in the next three days." "The mujer of Pablo reads in the hands," the gypsy said. "But she is so irritable that I do not know if she will do it." "Let us see the mujer of Pablo now," he said. "She has gypsy blood," Rafael said. "She knows of what she speaks. But she has a tongue that bites like a whip." "How does she get on with the girl, Maria?" Robert Jordan asked. "Good. She likes the girl. She takes good care of her," Anselmo said. "When we picked the girl up at the time of the train she was very strange," Rafael said. "She would not speak and she cried all the time." "It must have been very hard at the train," Anselmo said. "I was not there. There was the band of Pablo and the band of El Sordo, whom we will see tonight." "It was the only good thing we have done," said a deep voice. Robert Jordan saw a woman of about fifty almost as big as Pablo, almost as wide as she was tall, in a black peasant skirt with heavy wool socks on heavy legs, black rope-soled shoes and a brown face like a model for a granite monument. She had big but nice-looking hands and her thick curly black hair was twisted into a knot on her neck. "Hola," she said to Robert Jordan and put out her hand and smiled. "How are you and how is everything in the Republic?" "Good," he said and returned her strong handshake. "I am happy," she told him. She was looking into his face and smiling and he noticed she had fine gray eyes. "Do you come for us to do another train?" "No," said Robert Jordan, trusting her instantly. "For a bridge. We have to do this bridge." "Where is it?" "Quite close." "All the better," she said. "Let us blow all the bridges and get out. I am sick of this place." She saw Pablo through the trees. "Borracho!" she called to him. "Rotten drunkard! He drinks all the time. This life is ruining him. Young man, I am very glad that you have come. We will understand each other. Be very good and careful with the girl, Maria. She has had a bad time. Do you understand?" "Yes. Why do you say this?" "I saw her watching you. She was in a very bad state. Now she is better, she ought to get out of here. Pablo likes her too much. It is another thing which destroys him. It is best that she goes away now." "We can take her after this is over. If we are alive after the bridge, we will take her." "That manner of speaking never brings luck. Let me see your hand," the woman said. Robert Jordan put his hand out and the woman opened it, held it in her own big hand, rubbed her thumb over it and looked at it, carefully, then dropped it. She stood up. He got up too and she looked at him without smiling. "What did you see in it?" he asked her. "I don't believe in it. You won't scare me." "Nothing," she told him. "I saw nothing in it." "Yes you did. I am only curious. I do not believe in such things." "In what do you believe?" "In my work." "Yes, I saw that." "Tell me what else you saw." "I saw nothing else," she said bitterly. "The bridge is very difficult you said?" "No. I said it is very important. And now I am going down to look at it. How many men have you here?" "Five that are any good. The gypsy is worthless although his intentions are good. Pablo I no longer trust." "How many men has El Sordo that are good?" "Perhaps eight. He comes every night. He is a neighbor and a friend. Go now to your bridge," she said. Robert Jordan and Anselmo came down moving carefully from tree to tree in the shadows and the bridge was only fifty yards away. The sun was in Robert Jordan's eyes and the bridge showed only in outline. Then the sun lessened and was gone. He was watching the bridge again in the little light that was left and studied its construction. Its demolition was not difficult. He took out a notebook and made several quick line sketches. He was noting the points where the explosive should be placed in order to cut the support of the bridge and drop a section into the narrow valley. It could be done scientifically and correctly with a half dozen charges set to explode simultaneously; or it could be done roughly with two big ones. He was glad to have the problem under his hand at last. As Robert Jordan lay flat behind the pine trunk, Anselmo pointed with one finger. In the sentry box the sentry was sitting holding his rifle between his knees. The sentry had a peasant's face. Anselmo looked at the sentry as Robert Jordan smiled at him and pointing with one finger, drew the other across his throat. Robert Jordan nodded but he did not smile. "You have killed?" Robert Jordan asked. "Yes. Several times. But not with pleasure. To me it is a sin to kill a man. Even fascists whom we must kill." "Yet you have killed." "Yes. And will again. But if I live later, I will try to live in such a way, doing no harm to any one, that it will be forgiven." "By whom?" "Who knows? Since we do not have God here anymore, who forgives, I do not know." "You don't have God anymore?" "No. Certainly not. If there were God, he would never have permitted what I have seen with my eyes. Let them have God." "They demand Him." "Clearly I miss Him, having been brought up in religion. But now a man must be responsible to himself." "Then you will forgive yourself for killing." "I believe so," Anselmo said. "But with or without God, I think it is a sin to kill. I will do it whenever necessary but I am not of the race of Pablo." As they came through the rocks in the dark, a man spoke to them, "Halt. Who goes?" asked the voice of a man in the dark. "Comrades of Pablo," the old man told him. "How are you called?" Robert Jordan asked the man in the dark. "Agustin," the man said and coming close put his hand on Robert Jordan's shoulder. "Tell me, is it true about the bridge?" "What about the bridge?" "That we blow up a bridge and then have to get ourselves out of these mountains?" "I don't know." "You don't know," Agustin said. "Whose then is the dynamite?" "Mine. I know what it is for and so will you in time," Robert Jordan said. "But now we go to the camp." "Go to the unprintable," Agustin said, "but guard well your explosive." "We go to camp now. Come on," Robert Jordan said to Anselmo. "Agustin is a very serious man," Anselmo said. "I have much confidence in him and what he says." chapter THREE They came down to the mouth of the cave, where a light shone out from the edge of a blanket that hung over the opening. The two packs were at the foot of the tree covered with a canvas. Robert Jordan picked up the packs and carried them into the cave. It was warm and smoky inside. There was a table along one wall with a candle stuck in a bottle on it and at the table were seated Pablo, three men he did not know, and the gypsy, Rafael. The woman of Pablo was standing by the fire in the corner of the cave. The girl knelt by her, stirring in an iron pot. "What do you carry?" Pablo asked. "My things," Robert Jordan said and set the two packs down. "I do not like to have dynamite here in the cave," Pablo said. "It is far from the fire," Robert Jordan said. Anselmo brought him a stool and he sat down at the table. "How goes it, gypsy?" he said to Rafael. "Good," the gypsy said. Robert Jordan could tell they had been talking about him when he came in. "Is there wine?" Robert Jordan asked. "There is little left," Pablo said sullenly. Robert Jordan decided he had better look at the other three and try to see where he stood. "In that case, let me have a cup of water." He called to the girl, "Bring me a cup of water." She went to a kettle containing water and dipped a cup full and put it down before him. Robert Jordan smiled at her. He reached his hand down toward his hip pocket where the pistol was and Pablo watched him. "What we should do now is another train," Pablo said. "We can do that," Robert Jordan said. "After the bridge." When he said the word "bridge" everyone was quiet. "After the bridge," he said again deliberately. "I do not go for the bridge," Pablo said. Robert Jordan smiled and said, "Then we shall do it alone." "Without this coward," Anselmo said. "What did you say?" Pablo said to the old man. "Nothing for you. I did not speak to you," Anselmo told him. Robert Jordan now looked at the wife of Pablo who was standing by the fire. She had said nothing yet. But now she said something to the girl and the girl went out of the cave. I think it is going to come now, Robert Jordan thought. I believe this is it. "Then we will do the bridge without your aid," Robert Jordan said to Pablo. "No," Pablo said, and Robert Jordan watched his face sweat. "You will blow no bridge here." "And you?" Robert Jordan spoke to the wife of Pablo. "I am for the bridge." Her face was lit by the fire and it was flushed and handsome now in the firelight. "What do you say?" Pablo said to her. "I am for the bridge and against you," she said. All the others agreed with her. Robert Jordan watched Pablo and let his right hand hang lower and lower, ready if it should be necessary, half hoping it would be. He saw the wife of Pablo blush proudly as the allegiances were given. "I am for the Republic," she said happily. "And the Republic is the bridge. Afterwards we will have time for other projects." "And it means nothing to you to be hunted then like a beast after this thing from which we derive no profit? Nor to die in it?" "Nothing," the woman of Pablo said. "And do not try to frighten me, coward." "Coward," Pablo said bitterly. "You treat a man as a coward because he has a tactical sense. Because he can see the results of an idiocy in advance. It is not cowardly to know what is foolish. Am I the only one who sees the seriousness of this?" I believe so, Old Pablo, Robert Jordan thought. Except me. You can see it and I see it and the woman reads it in my hand but she doesn't see it, yet. "Am I a leader for nothing?" Pablo asked. "This foreigner comes here to do a thing for the good of the foreigners. For his good we must be sacrificed. I am for the good and the safety of all." "Safety," the wife of Pablo said. "There is no such thing as safety. In seeking safety now you lose all." "There is safety," Pablo said. "Within the danger there is the safety of knowing what chances to take." "Here no one commands but me. Haven't you heard la gente? Here I command!" "I should shoot you and the foreigner," Pablo said sullenly. I don't think he is going to take this much more, Robert Jordan thought. He held the cup in one hand and his other hand now rested on the pistol. Pablo looked at Robert Jordan and then at his mujer. "All right. You command," he said. "And if you want he can command too. And the two of you can go to hell." "Maria, enter now and serve the supper," the woman of Pablo called. The girl came in and picked up the bowls and brought them to the table. "Well, did you see the bridge?" the gypsy asked. "Yes," Robert Jordan said. "It is easy to do." He took out the notebook and showed them the sketches and explained how it would be blown up. Everyone was listening. Only Pablo took no interest, sitting by himself with a cup of wine. "Have you done much of this?" the girl asked Robert Jordan softly. "Yes." "And can we see the doing of it?" "Yes. Why not?" "You will see it," Pablo said from his end of the table. "Shut up," the woman of Pablo said to him and suddenly remembering what she had seen in the hand in the afternoon she was wildly, unreasonably angry. "Shut up, coward. Shut up, bad luck bird." "I shut up. It is you who commands now. But remember that I am not stupid." The woman of Pablo could feel her anger changing to sorrow and to a feeling of hopelessness. She knew this feeling from when she was a girl and it came now suddenly and she put it away from her and would not let it touch neither her nor the Republic. "Now we will eat. Serve the bowls from the pot, Maria," she said. Robert Jordan pushed aside the blanket that hung over the mouth of the cave and, stepping out, took a deep breath of the cold night air. The gypsy stepped out of the cave too and said softly, "Roberto." "Yes, Rafael," he said. "Why did you not kill Pablo?" "Why kill him?" "You have to kill him sooner or later. Why did you not approve of the moment? What do you think they all waited for? Do you believe it is possible to continue after what has been said?" "I thought it might molest the others or the woman." "Kill him now," the gypsy urged. "I cannot in that way. It is repugnant to me and it is not how one should act for the cause." "Provoke him then," the gypsy said. "But you have to kill him. There is no remedy." Robert Jordan walked away through the pines, feeling his way from tree to tree. I am tired, he thought, and perhaps my judgment is not good. But my obligation is the bridge and to fulfill that I must take no useless risk of myself until I complete that duty. If it is true, as the gypsy says, that they expected me to kill Pablo then I should have done that. But it was never clear to me. While I trust the woman absolutely, I could not tell how she would react to such a drastic thing. As his eyes became used to the starlight he could see that Pablo was talking to one of the horses, and he decided that it was not a practical move to kill him at this time. Robert Jordan returned to the cave. "It is strange that El Sordo has not come," the woman said. "He should have been here an hour ago. If he does not come we must go to see him tomorrow." "May I go too, Pilar?" Maria asked. "Yes, beautiful," the woman said, then turning her big face, "Isn't she pretty?" she asked Robert Jordan. "How does she seem to you? A little thin?" "To me she seems very well," Robert Jordan said. Maria filled his cup with wine. "Drink that," she said. "It will make me seem even better." "Then I had better stop," Robert Jordan said. "Already you seem beautiful and more." Pilar looked at him and asked, "Are you a Communist?" "No, I am an anti-fascist." "For a long time?" "Since I have understood fascism." "How long is that?" "For nearly ten years." "That is not much time," the woman said. "I have been a Republican for twenty years." "My father was a Republican all his life," Maria said. "It was for that they shot him." "My father was also a Republican all his life. Also my grandfather," Robert Jordan said. "In what country?" "The United States." "Did they shoot them?" the woman asked. "The United States is a country of Republicans," Maria said. "They don't shoot you for being a Republican there." "Listen, American. Where do you plan to sleep?" Pilar asked. "Outside. I have a sleeping robe." "Good, then sleep outside. And your materials can sleep with me." "Leave us for a moment," Robert Jordan said to the girl and put his hand on her shoulder. "Why?" "I wish to speak to Pilar." "What is it?" the woman of Pablo said when the girl had gone out. "The gypsy said I should have-" he began. "No," the woman interrupted. "He is mistaken." "If it is necessary that I-" Robert Jordan said quietly but with difficulty. "You would have done it, I believe," the woman said. "No, it is not necessary. Your judgment was good." Then she called the girl. The girl came in and Robert Jordan reached his hand out and patted her head. She stroked under his hand like a kitten. "You would do well to go to bed now," the woman said to Robert Jordan. "I will get my things," he said. chapter FOUR He was asleep in the robe on the forest floor and he had been asleep, he thought, for a long time. Then he felt her hand on his shoulder and turned quickly, his right hand holding the pistol under the robe. "Oh, it is you," he said and pulled her down. With his arms around her he could feel her shivering. "Get in," he said softly. "It is cold out there. Get in, little rabbit." He kissed her on the back of the neck. "I am afraid." "No. Do not be afraid. Get in." "No, I must not. I am ashamed and frightened." "No. My rabbit. Please." "I must not. If you do not love me." "I love you." "Oh, I love you. Put your hand on my head," she said, her face in the pillow. He put his hand on her head and stroked it and then suddenly her face was away from the pillow and she was in his arms and her face was against his and she was crying. "I cannot kiss," she said. "I do not know how." "There is no need to kiss." "Yes. I must kiss. I must do everything. I want to be your woman." "Have you loved others?" "Never." Then suddenly, going dead in his arms, "But things were done to me." "By whom?" "By various." Now she lay perfectly quietly and as though her body were dead and turned her head away from him. "Now you will not love me." "I love you, Maria," he said. "No. It is not true," she said. Then pitifully and hopefully she said, "But I have never kissed any man." "Then kiss me now. "But I do not know how. Where things were done to me I fought until I could not see and then they tied my mouth and held my arms behind my head - and others did things to me." "I love you, and no one has done anything to you." "You believe that?" "I know it." She kissed him on the cheek. "Where do the noses go? I always wondered where the noses would go." "Look, turn your head," and then their mouths were tight together and he was happier than he had ever been. They lay there and he felt her heart beating against his. "Maria, listen. Do you-?" "Do I what?" "Do you wish?" "Yes. Everything. Please. And if we do everything together, the other maybe never will have been. Pilar told me." "She is very wise." "The other thing she told me long ago, soon after the train. She said that nothing is done to oneself that one does not accept and that if I love someone it would take it all away." "What she said is true." "And I can be your woman?" "Yes, my little rabbit." She held herself tight to him and her lips looked for his and then found them. "And now let us do quickly what it is we do so that the other is all gone." "You want?" "Yes," she said almost fiercely. "Yes. Yes. Yes." It was cold in the night and Robert Jordan slept heavily. Once he woke and realized that the girl was there, curled far down in the robe, breathing lightly and regularly. He kissed her smooth shoulder. He woke at first daylight and the girl was gone. Then he fell asleep again. He slept until the sound of airplane motors woke him. Lying on his back, he saw them, a fascist patrol of three Fiats, small, bright, fast-moving across the sky. Pablo and the gypsy were standing at the cave mouth watching the sky and as Robert Jordan lay still, the sky was now full of the loud noise of motors. Robert Jordan unrolled the clothing that made his pillow and put on his shirt and trousers as three more of the Heinkel bombers came over. He moved quickly along the rocks to the mouth of the cave where Pablo, the gypsy, Anselmo, the woman and others stood looking out. "Have there been planes like this before?" he asked. "Never," said Pablo. "Get in. They will see you." This is really bad, Robert Jordan thought. Here is a concentration of planes which means something very bad. Anselmo came out of the cave mouth and they walked a little way. "I want you to go and watch the road. Make a note of everything that passes both up and down the road." "I do not write." "There is no need to," Robert Jordan took out two leaves from his notebook and with his knife cut an inch from the end of his pencil. "Take this and make a mark for tanks like this," he drew a tank, "and then a mark for each one and when there are four, cross the four strokes for the fifth." "We count like this too." "Good. Make another mark, two wheels and a box, for trucks. If they are empty make a circle. If they are full of troops make a straight mark. Mark for guns. Mark for cars. Mark for ambulances. You understand?" "Yes. It is clear." "Take the gypsy with you so that he will know where you are. Stay until someone else comes." "I understand." "Good. When you come back I should know everything that moved upon the road." They walked over toward the cave. The woman of Pablo poured him a bowl of coffee with condensed milk. "What movement was there on the road last night, Fernando?" Robert Jordan asked. Maria was close to him but he did not look at her. "Nothing," Fernando said. "A few camions as usual. No movement of troops while I was there." After a while Fernando said, "Oh, yes. It seems that the Republic is preparing an offensive." "That what?" "That the Republic is preparing an offensive." "Where?" "It is not certain. Perhaps here, or in another part of the Sierra." "They say this in La Granja?" "Yes. I had forgotten." "What else did you hear?" Robert Jordan asked. "Oh, yes. There was some talk that the Republicans would try to blow up the bridges." "Are you joking?" Robert Jordan said. "No, hombre," said Fernando. "This one doesn't joke," the woman said. "You don't remember anything more?" "No," Fernando said with dignity. Robert Jordan turned to Anselmo and the gypsy and said, "Now go, if you have eaten." The first sound of the planes returned. They stood in the mouth of the cave and watched them. They move like mechanized doom, Robert Jordan thought. It was a clear, bright day. Robert Jordan looked at the big, brown-faced woman with her kind, widely set eyes. The woman, too, was looking at him. "Did you make love?" the woman said. "What did she say?" "She would not tell me." "I neither." "Then you made love," the woman said. "Be as careful with her as you can." "What if she has a baby?" "That will do no harm," the woman said. "That will do less harm." "This is no place for that." "She will not stay here. She will go with you." "I can't take a woman where I go." "Who knows? You may take two." "That is no way to talk." "Listen," the woman said. "I see things very clearly in the early morning and I think there are many that we know that are alive now who will never see another Sunday." "What day is today?" "Sunday." "Another Sunday is very far," said Robert Jordan. "If we see Wednesday we are all right. But I do not like to hear you talk like this." "Everyone needs to talk to someone," the woman said. "Before we had religion and other nonsense. Now there should be someone to whom one can speak frankly, for all the valor that one could have one becomes very alone." "We are not alone. We are all together." "We are nothing against machines," said Pilar. She was touched by sadness. Robert Jordan looked at her and said, "You are sad, why?" "Perhaps I am sad because of that failure of a man who has gone to look at his horses." "How did you come to be with him?" Pilar told Robert Jordan about the first days of the movement when Pablo was a man of valor. "But now he is ruined. He is afraid to die. His own people have left him and I am in command. But my sadness does not affect my resolution. I believe firmly in the Republic and I have faith in the cause." "I believe that," he said and went into the cave where Maria was standing. "Hello, little rabbit," he said and kissed her on the mouth. She embraced him. Fernando, still sitting at the table, stood up, picked up his carbine and went out. Agustin looked at Pilar and said very seriously, "What do you think they are preparing?" "Look," Pilar said. "From this boy coming for the bridges obviously the Republic is preparing an offensive. From these planes obviously the fascists are preparing to meet it. But why show the planes?" "In this war there are many foolish things," Agustin said. "Clearly," said Pilar. "Otherwise we could not be here." "Yes," said Agustin. "We swim within the idiocy for a year now. But Pablo is a man of much understanding. Pablo is very clever. For the coward that he now is, he is very smart." "I, too, am smart." "No, Pilar," Agustin said. "You are not smart. You are brave, loyal. You have decision, intuition and heart. But you are not smart." "You believe that?" the woman asked thoughtfully. "Yes, Pilar. In this moment we need to act with intelligence. After the bridge we must leave at once. We must know for where we are leaving and how. And for this we need Pablo." "You are a man of intelligence." "Intelligent, yes," Agustin said. "But Pablo has talent. To make war you need intelligence. But to win you need talent and material. We need Pablo." "I will think it over," she said. "We must start now. We are late." chapter FIVE Let us rest," Pilar said. "Sit down here, Maria, and rest." "We should continue," Robert Jordan said. "Rest when we get there. I must see this man." "You will see him. There is no hurry. I rest now," the woman said. "I want to bathe my feet in the stream." She looked at Maria and Robert Jordan. "How would you like to be ugly, beautiful one?" she said to Maria. "You are not ugly." "I was born ugly. All my life I have been ugly. Do you know what it is to be ugly all your life and inside to feel that you are beautiful? It is very rare. I would have made a good man, but I am all woman and all ugly. Yet many men have loved me and I have loved many men. It is curious." "No," said Maria. "You are not ugly." "Try to use your head and not your heart," Pilar said. "Where were you at the start of the movement?" Robert Jordan asked. "In my town." "And what happened?" "Much," the woman said. "Much. And all of it ugly." "Tell me about it," Robert Jordan said. "It is brutal. I do not like to tell it before the girl." "I can hear it," Maria said. She put her hand on Robert Jordan's. "There is nothing that I cannot hear." The girl leaned back against the heather and Robert Jordan stretched himself out on the ground and found Maria's hand and held it in his. Pilar began telling them how Pablo had surrounded the barracks of the guardia civil in the dark, had cut the telephone wires and had blown the wall open. She explained in detail how Pablo had finished off the wounded guards and had executed the other four by having them kneel against the wall and shooting them in the back of the head. She told of how the fascists of the town had been seized in their homes and taken to the Ayuntamiento. There a priest confessed them and gave them the necessary sacraments. While this was going on, Pablo organized the townspeople in two lines with about two meters between the lines. These lines extended from the Ayuntamiento to the edge of the cliff. The townspeople were given flails to beat the fascists to death as they walked between the lines. Some used clubs and pitch forks. Once they had been beaten to death they were thrown over the cliff and into the river. When Pablo was asked why this was being done, he answered that he wanted to save bullets and that each man should have his share in the responsibility. "That night when everything was over I felt hollow and full of shame, and I had a great feeling of oppression and of bad to come. And bad came after three days, when the fascists took over the town," Pilar said. "Do not tell me about it," said Maria. "I do not want to hear it. This is enough. This is too much." "I wish you would tell me of it sometime," Robert Jordan said. "I will," Pilar said. "But not now." They got up and started walking. As they came up the trail a man with a carbine stepped out from behind a tree. "Halt," he said. "Hola, Pilar. Who is with you?" "An Ingles," Pilar said. "Salud Camarada." the guard said to Robert Jordan and put out his hand. He was very young and his eyes were friendly. "Are you the dynamiter?" Joaquin asked. "Yes, I am the dynamiter." "Is it for a train?" "Were you at the last train?" Robert Jordan asked. "Yes, I was. That's where we got her," he grinned at Maria. Joaquin's father, mother, sister and brother-in-law had been killed by the fascists. Finally they came to a short and heavy man. He put out a big brown hand to Pilar. "Hola," he said to Robert Jordan and shook his hand and looked him in the face. His eyes were yellow as a cat's and flat as a reptile's eyes are. El Sordo nodded. "Ingles?" he asked. "Americano." "Same as Ingles. When blow bridge?" "You know about the bridge?" El Sordo nodded. "Day after tomorrow morning." "Good," said El Sordo. "Pablo?" he asked Pilar. She shook her head. El Sordo grinned and looked at Robert Jordan and said, "Much troop movement." "Where?" "Segovia. Planes you saw." "Bad, eh?" "Bad. Why not blow bridge tonight?" "I have my orders." "I don't like it," El Sordo said. "Nor I," said Robert Jordan. "How many men have you?" "Eight," said El Sordo. "To cut the telephone, attack the post, take it and fall back on the bridge," said Robert Jordan. "It is easy." "It will all be written out." "Don't trouble." "And afterwards for the retreat? Where are we going to go when this is done?" Pilar shouted into El Sordo's ear. He shrugged his shoulders. "All that must be arranged," the woman said. "Of course," said El Sordo. "There are many places. You know Gredos? We can get to Gredos as well as to anywhere else, traveling at night. Here it is very dangerous now." "But I think you could operate very well from the Gredos," said Robert Jordan. "What?" El Sordo said and looked at him with his eyes very flat. There was no friendliness in the way he asked the question. "You could raid more effectively from there," Robert Jordan said. "So," El Sordo said. "You know Gredos?" "Yes. You could operate against the main line of the railway from there. You are more useful there," Robert Jordan said. They had both gotten sullen as he talked. I have made a mistake, Robert Jordan thought to himself. When I should have flattered them I told them what I think they should do and now they are furious. "Listen," Pilar said to him. "How are your nerves?" "All right," said Robert Jordan. "Because the last dynamiter they sent, Kashkin, although a formidable technician, was very nervous." "We have nervous ones," Robert Jordan said. "Now he is dead." "How was that?" El Sordo asked. "I shot him because he was too badly wounded to travel and he did not want to be left behind." "Was it a train?" El Sordo asked. "Yes," said Robert Jordan. "Are you sure your nerves are all right?" Pilar said to Robert Jordan. "Yes," he told her, "and I think that when we terminate this of the bridge you should go to the Gredos." As he said that, the woman started to curse in a flood of obscene language. El Sordo shook his head at Robert Jordan and grinned, and Robert Jordan knew that it was all right again now. Finally she stopped cursing, took a drink of water and said calmly, "We'll see what happens." "You see, Comrade," El Sordo explained, "it is the morning that is difficult." He was not talking the pidgin Spanish now and was calm. "I understand your needs and I know the posts must be exterminated and the bridge covered while you do your work. This is easy to do before daylight or at daylight. But to leave afterward and get out of this country in daylight presents a grave problem." "Clearly, I have thought of it. It is daylight for me also." "But you are one," El Sordo said. "We are various. You could not do it at night?" "I would be shot for it." "It is possible we will all be shot for it if you do it in the daytime." "For me that is less important once the bridge is blown, but I see your viewpoint. Can you work out a retreat for daylight?" "Certainly," El Sordo said. "We will work out such a retreat. But you speak of going to Gredos. To arrive at Gredos would be a miracle." Robert Jordan said nothing. "Listen to me," El Sordo said. "We exist here by a miracle. By a miracle of laziness and stupidity of the fascists which they will remedy in time. We must think much about this. Let us eat now. I have talked much." "I appreciate your aid and your loyalty," Robert Jordan said. They left El Sordo's after eating and started down the trail. It was hot in the late May afternoon and the woman stopped. Her face looked pale. Robert Jordan said, "Let us rest a minute. We go too fast." "Rest, Pilar," Maria said. "You look bad." "All right," said Pilar and the three sat down under a pine tree. "Come here, guapa, and put your head in my lap," said Pilar. Maria moved close to her, put her arms out and folded them as one does who goes to sleep without a pillow and lay with her head on her arms. She turned her face up at Pilar and smiled at her but the big woman looked at the mountains. "You can have her in a little while, Ingles," she said. "Do not talk like that," Maria said. "Yes, he can have you. But I am jealous," Pilar said and ran her finger around the lobe of the girl's ear. "I am very jealous. I love you and he can have you." "I love you, too," said Maria. "Now I will leave the two of you. I am only jealous that you are nineteen. It is not a jealousy which lasts. You will not be nineteen always. Now I go." She walked off into the heather toward the stream. Robert Jordan and Maria walked through the heather of the mountain meadow and from the palm of her hand against the palm of his, from their fingers locked together, something came that was like a current that filled his whole body with an aching hollowness of wanting. He held her to him and kissed her. He felt her trembling as he kissed her and he held her body tight to him. Then her lips were on his throat, and he put her down and said, "Maria, oh, my Maria." Then he said, "Where should we go?" She did not say anything but slipped her hand inside of his shirt and he felt her undoing the shirt buttons. There was the smell of heather and the sun bright on her closed eyes and all his life he would remember the curve of her throat with her head pushed back into the heather roots. They were both there and he felt time had stopped and he felt the earth move out and away from under them. Then he was lying on his side, his head deep in the heather, and the girl was lying opposite him with her eyes still shut and then she opened them and smiled at him and he said very tiredly, "Hello, rabbit." And she smiled and said, "Hello, my Ingles." As they were walking along the stream he said, "Maria, I love you and you are so lovely and so wonderful and so beautiful and it does such things to me to be with you that I feel as though I wanted to die when I am loving you." "Oh," she said. "I die each time. Do you not die?" "No. Almost. But did you feel the earth move?" "Yes. As I died." He was walking beside her but his mind was thinking of the problem of the bridge now. Then he started to think of all the things that might go wrong. Stop it, he told himself. You mustn't worry. You know the things that may happen. Now he was forced to use these people whom he liked as you should use troops toward whom you have no feeling at all if you are to be successful. Pablo was the smartest. He knew how bad it was instantly. The woman was all for it, and still was. Sordo recognized it instantly and would do it but he did not like it any more than he, Robert Jordan, liked it. No, he would carry out the orders and it was bad luck that you liked the people you must do it with. And what are you going to do afterwards? I am going back and earn my living teaching Spanish as before, I am going to write a true book and I am going to marry Maria. Spanish girls make wonderful wives. I've never had one so I know. But in the meantime all the life you have or ever will have is today, tonight, tomorrow, over and over again (I hope), he thought and so you had better take what time there is and be thankful for it. I suppose it is possible to live as full a life in seventy hours as in seventy years; granted that your life has been full and that you have reached a certain age. If you love this girl as much as you say you do, you had better love her very hard and make up in intensity what the relation will lack in duration and in continuity. There is nothing else than now. There is neither yesterday, nor is there any tomorrow. So now do not worry, take what you have, and do your work and you will have a long and happy life. Hasn't it been happy lately? "I love you, rabbit," he said to the girl. He and Maria talked and made their way back to the camp. Before reaching the camp they met Pilar. The sun had clouded over and as Robert Jordan looked back up toward the mountains the sky was now heavy and gray. "It will snow," said Pilar. "It can't be snow," he said. "Just the same," she said to him, "it will snow." chapter six By the time they reached the camp it was snowing and the flakes were dropping diagonally through the pines and Robert Jordan stood in front of the cave in a rage and watched them. "We will have much snow," Pablo said. His voice was thick and his eyes were red and bleary. "Has the gypsy come in?" Robert Jordan asked him. "No," Pablo said. "Neither him nor the old man." "Will you come with me to the upper post of the road?" "I will take no part in this." "I will find it myself." "In this storm you might miss it," Pablo said. "I would not go now." Pablo looked at the snow that was blowing fast now past the mouth of the cave and said, "You do not like the snow?" Robert Jordan swore and Pablo laughed. "With this your offensive fails, Ingles," he said. "Come into the cave." "This snow," Robert Jordan said. "You think there will be much?" "Much," Pablo said contentedly. Then he called to Pilar, "You don't like it, woman, either? Now that you command you do not like this snow?" "If it snows, it snows." "Drink some wine, Ingles," Pablo said. "I have been drinking all day waiting for the snow." "Give me a cup," Robert Jordan said. "To the snow," Pablo said and touched cups with him. Robert Jordan looked him in the eyes and clinked his cup. You bleary-eyed murderous fool, he thought. I'd like to clink this cup against your teeth. Take it easy, he told himself. He went over to Maria and said, "Very beautiful, the snow." "But it is had for the work, isn't it?" she asked him. "Aren't you worried?" "Worrying is no good." The drunken man looked at him and grinned. "No offensive. No aviones. No bridge. Just snow," Pablo said. "You expect it to last a long time?" Robert Jordan said. "Tonight and tomorrow, yes." "What makes you think so?" "I transported goods across the mountains with the big carts before the camions came into use. In that business we learned the weather." "But what were you doing before the movement?" "I worked for a horse contractor of Zaragoza. He furnished horses for the bull rings. It was then that I met Pilar who was with the matador Finito de Palencia." "He wasn't much of a matador," one of the brothers said. "No?" Pilar said. "He wasn't much of a matador?" She saw Finito, the not-so-good matador, now standing in front of the bull. She saw him clearly now and she heard his thin, clear voice as he turned his head and looked toward the people above the red fence and said, "Let's see if we can kill him like this!" She could hear the voice and see all his movements inside the ring. "He was a good matador," Pablo said. "He was handicapped by his short stature." "And clearly he had tuberculosis," Primitivo said. "Tuberculosis?" Pilar said. "Who wouldn't have tuberculosis in this country where no poor man can ever hope to make money unless he is a criminal or a bullfighter, or a tenor in the opera? In a country where the bourgeoisie over-eat so that their stomachs are ruined and the poor are hungry from their birth until the day they die. He was short of stature and he had a thin voice and much fear of bulls. Never have I seen a man with more fear before the bullfight and never have I seen a man with less fear in the ring." "I remember," the first brother said. "I was in the ring. It was a soap-colored one with a curly forehead and with very high horns. It was the last bull he killed in Valladolid." "Exactly," Pilar said. "And afterwards the club of enthusiasts who had taken his name for their club had the head of the bull mounted and presented it to him at a small banquet. During the meal they had the head on the wall, but it was covered with a cloth. I was at the table and others were there too. Finito did not eat much because he had received a palotaxo, a blow from the horn of a bull he had killed in his last corrida of the year at Zaragoza, and even now he could not hold food on his stomach. He would put his handkerchief to his mouth and deposit a quantity of blood in it at intervals throughout the banquet. He was suffering much during the banquet. "The president of the club began the speech which was to precede the uncovering of the head. I was watching Finito who was making use of his, no, my, napkin and sinking further back in his chair and staring with horror and fascination at the shrouded bull's head on the wall opposite him. "So the president of the club reached the end of the speech and then, with everybody cheering him, he pulled the purple shroud off the head. Everyone applauded and Finito sank further back in the chair and said, "No. No." and looked at the bull and pulled further back and then a big blob of blood came out and he didn't even put up the napkin and it slid down his chin." "How long after that did he die?" Primitivo asked. "That winter," Pilar said. Just then the gypsy came in the door. He was covered with snow. Robert Jordan stood up and went over to the door, "Well?" he said to the gypsy. "Six-hour watches, two men at a time on the big bridge," the gypsy said. "There are eight men and a corporal at the hut." "And the road?" Robert Jordan asked. "The same movement as always," the gypsy said. "Nothing out of the usual. Several motor cars." "Let us go for the old man," Robert Jordan said. "Not me," the gypsy said. "I go now for the fire and the hot soup. Who wants to guide the Ingles?" he asked. "I will go," Fernando rose. "Tell me where it is." Anselmo was sitting on the trunk of a big tree and the snow blew past on either side. If I stay here much longer I will freeze, he thought. The Ingles told me to stay until someone comes but he did not know about the storm. Anselmo was so cold now that he decided he had best go to camp before it was dark. But the Ingles told me to stay, he thought. Even now he may be on the way here and, if I leave this place, he may lose himself in the snow searching for me. All through this war we have suffered from a lack of discipline and from disobeying orders and I will wait for him a while still. But if he does not come soon I must go in spite of all orders. Across the road at the mill the fascists are warm and comfortable, he thought, and tomorrow night we will kill them. It is a strange thing and I do not like to think of it. I have watched them all and they are the same men that we are. They should never be fighting against us and I do not like to think of the killing. I think that after the war there will have to be some great penance done for the killing. If we no longer have religion after the war then I think there must be some form of civic penance organized that all may be cleansed from the killing. "Hola, viejo," Robert Jordan whispered and clapped him on the back. "How's the old one?" "Very cold," Anselmo said. "Come on," Robert Jordan whispered. "Go to camp and get warm. It was a crime to leave you here so long." He stayed as he was told, Robert Jordan thought. That's the rarest thing that can happen in Spain. They slowly walked up the hill in the snow to the camp. They reached the smoky warmth of the cave and Pilar said, "El Sordo was here. He has gone to look for horses." Pablo was sitting at the table and grinned and waved his hand. "It's still falling." Robert Jordan nodded at him. "Let me take your shoes and dry them over the fire," said Maria. "Be careful not to burn them," said Robert Jordan. "Let me take your jacket," said Maria. "Do not let the snow melt on it. Go and dry your feet and let me bring you something warm to drink." "You would think a man had never wet his feet before," Pilar said. "Roberto," Maria said, "are you ready to eat?" "Have the others eaten?" "All except you, Anselmo and Fernando." "Let us eat then. And you?" "Afterwards, with Pilar." "Eat now with us." "No, it would not be well. Here it is better to eat after." "Eat with him," Pablo said. "Drink with him. Sleep with him. Die with him. Follow the customs of his country." "Are you drunk?" Robert Jordan said. Pablo looked at him happily and said, "Yes." "I liked you better when you were barbarous," the woman said. "Of all men the drunkard is the worst. He stinks and vomits in his own bed and dissolves his organs in alcohol." "Listen, Ingles," Agustin said. "How did you happen to come to Spain? Pay no attention to Pablo. He is drunk." "I came first twelve years ago to study the country and the language," Robert Jordan said. "I teach Spanish in a university." "But why Spanish?" Andres asked. "Would it not be easier to teach English since you are English?" "He speaks Spanish as we do," Anselmo said. "Why should he not teach Spanish?" "Yes. But it is, in a way, presumptuous for a foreigner to teach Spanish," Fernando said. "I mean nothing against you, Don Roberto." "Mule," Pilar said. "He teaches Spanish to Americans. North Americans who speak English." "Do you think this snow will last?" Robert Jordan asked Pablo. "Ask another. I am not your service of information. Ask the woman," said Pablo. I'd like to kill him, Robert Jordan was thinking. I don't know what he is going to do, but it is nothing good. Day after tomorrow we want to blow up the bridge and this man is bad and he is a danger to the success of the whole operation. Let us get it over with. "Cobarde," Robert Jordan said to him. "It is very possible," Pablo said. "But I am not to be provoked." "Shut your mouth," Robert Jordan said. "I provoke you for myself." "It is not worth the trouble," Pablo told him. "I do not provoke." He's rare, all right, Robert Jordan thought, and smart, and very complicated. "Here's to you," Robert Jordan said, and dipped a cup into the wine bowl. Betrayal wouldn't amount to anything without all these pledges, he thought. "Salud, Pablo," Robert Jordan said. "I'm learning much from you." "I am teaching the professor," Pablo nodded his head. "Come on, Don Roberto, we will be friends." "We are good friends already." "I'm going to get out of here," Agustin said. "What is the matter, negro? Don't you like to see friendship between Don Roberto and me?" "Watch your mouth about calling me negro." Agustin went over to him and stood in front of Pablo holding his hands low. "So you are called," Pablo said. "Not by you." Agustin hit him hard across the mouth with his left hand. Pablo sat there. The corners of his mouth were wine-stained and his expression did not change, but Robert Jordan watched his eyes change. Agustfn hit him again on the mouth with his closed fist. Robert Jordan was holding his pistol in his hand under the table. He pushed Maria away with his left hand. The round-headed man sat staring at Agustin from his flat little eyes. He licked his lips, put up an arm and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, looked down and saw the blood on his hand. "I am not a fool. I do not provoke." Agustin hit him again hard in the mouth and Pablo laughed at him, showing the yellow, bad, broken teeth in the reddened line of his mouth. "Nobody here has the courage to kill me. I am going to the horses. Even from behind they are better looking and have more sense than these people," he said and grinned. "Speak to them of the bridge, Roberto. Explain their duties in the attack. Tell them about the retreat. Where will you take your patriots after the bridge? I have thought of it all day while I was drinking." "What have you thought?" Agustfn asked. "I have thought you are a group of illusioned people, led by a woman with her brains between her legs and a foreigner who comes to destroy you." "Get out," Pilar shouted. Agustfn was worried. chapter SEVEN "Now, Ingles," Pilar said, "you have seen how he is." "What will he do?" Robert Jordan asked. "Anything. He is capable of doing anything," the woman said. "Kill him. I am for it now." "I was against it," Agustin said. "Now I am for it." "Let all speak," Pilar said and her voice was tired. "You, Andres?" "Matailo," one brother said. "Eladio?" "Equally," the other brother said. "Primitivo?" "Equally." "Fernando?" "Equally." "I am ready to do it. Since you are all decided that it should be done, I will do it tonight," Robert Jordan said. He saw Pilar looking at him, her fingers on her lips. She was looking toward the door. Pablo entered and grinned at them all. "You are speaking of me?" he addressed them all. "I am interrupting?" No one answered him and he walked over to the table. He picked up his cup and dipped it into the wine bowl. "Agustin," Robert Jordan said. "I wish to speak to you." Robert Jordan walked to the opening of the cave and Agustin followed him "Have you forgotten what is in the sacks?" Robert Jordan said, speaking so low that no one could hear. "Milk!" Agustin said. "One becomes accustomed and one forgets." "I, too, forgot." "What fools we are." Agustin swung back to the table and sat down. "Have a drink, Pablo, old boy," he said. "How were the horses?" "Very good," Pablo said. "And it is snowing less." "Do you think it will stop?" "Yes," Pablo said. "The wind will blow but the snow is going." "Do you think it will clear tomorrow?" Robert Jordan asked him. "Yes," Pablo said. "I believe it will be cold and clear. This wind is changing direction." Look at him, Robert Jordan thought. Now he is friendly. He has the face and the body of a pig and I know he is many times a murderer and yet has the sensitivity of a good aneroid. He pushes his hatred with insults to the point where you are ready to do away with him and when he sees that this point has been reached he drops it and starts all new and clean again. "We will have good weather for it," Pablo said to Robert Jordan. "We," Pilar said. "We?" "Yes, we," Pablo grinned at her and drank some wine. "Why not? I thought it over while I was outside. Why should we not agree?" "In what?" the woman asked. "In all," Pablo said to her. "In this of the bridge. With the change of the weather I am with you. Before I was drunk, and now I am not drunk. I have changed my mind." "Let the others trust you. I do not," Agustin said. "Trust me or not, there is no one who can take you to Gredos as I can," Pablo said. "Gredos?" "It is the only place to go after this of the bridge." Robert Jordan, looking at Pilar, raised his hand on the side away from Pablo and tapped his right ear questioningly. The woman nodded. She said something to Maria and the girl came over to Robert Jordan's side. "She says, 'Of course he heard,'" Maria said in Robert Jordan's ear. It is like a merry-go-round, Robert Jordan thought. It has been around twice now. It is a vast wheel, set at an angle, and each time it goes around and then is back to where it starts. Robert Jordan was sitting at the table with his notebook figuring all the technical part of the bridge-blowing. He drew three sketches, figured his formulas, marked the method of blowing with two drawings as clearly as a kindergarten project so that Anselmo could complete it in case anything should happen to himself during the process of the demolition. Now he had finished the demolition project and he took a new page of the notebook and started to write out the operation orders. He was thinking clearly and well on these and what he wrote pleased him. I think that is all, he said to himself. It is perfectly clear and I do not think there are any holes in it. He shut the notebook and looked up at Maria. "Did you make anything out of all that?" "No, Roberto," the girl said and put her hand on his. "Have you finished?" "Yes. Now it is all written out and ordered." He sat back and started thinking. "What do you do sitting there?" Maria asked him. "Nothing," he said. "I'm thinking." "About the bridge?" "No. The bridge is terminated. Of you and of a hotel in Madrid where I know some Russians, and of a book I will write some time." "Are there many Russians in Madrid?" "No. Very few." "Do you like the Russians? The one who was here was a Russian," Maria said. "He was a good friend and comrade of mine," Robert Jordan said. "I cared for him very much." "Sure," Pilar said. "But you shot him." The card players looked up from the table and the gypsy asked, "Is it true, Roberto?" "Yes," he said. "At his request. He was badly wounded." "All the time he was with us he talked of such a possibility. What a rare thing," the gypsy said. "You are a professor and all. Do you believe in the possibility of a man seeing ahead what is to happen to him?" Andres said. "I believe he cannot see it," Robert Jordan said. "That is ignorance and superstition. I believe that fear produces evil visions. I do not believe in the supernatural things." "But your Russian comrade saw his fate clearly," the gypsy said. "And that was how it happened." "He did not see it," Robert Jordan said. "You are a miracle of deafness," Pilar said. "It is not that you are stupid. You are simply deaf. One who is deaf cannot hear the radio. So he might say, never having heard it, that such a thing does not exist. I saw the death of your Russian comrade in his face as though it were burned there with a branding iron. And what is more he smelt of death." "He smelt of death," Robert Jordan jeered. "Of fear maybe. There is a smell to fear." "De la muerte," Pilar said. "Pablo, do you believe this?" "I do not know," Pablo said. "I am more of your opinion. No supernatural thing has ever happened to me. But fear, yes certainly. Plenty. But I believe that Pilar can read events from the hand. If she does not lie perhaps it is true that she has smelt such a thing." "What she says is true, Ingles," the gypsy said. "It is a well-known thing among us." "I believe nothing of it," Robert Jordan said. "I am against all such wizardry. But Pilar has the fame of being very advanced in such things," Anselmo said. Robert Jordan went to the mouth of the cave, lifted the blanket and looked out. It was clear and cold in the night outside and no snow was falling. The air came into his lungs sharp and cold as he breathed. He dropped the blanket and came back into the cave. "It is clear," he said. "The storm is over." Now in the night he lay and waited for the girl to come to him. The night was clear and his head felt as clear and cold as the air. He smelled the odor of the pine branches under him and the sharper odor of the resinous sap from the cut limbs. Pilar, he thought. Pilar and the smell of death. This is the smell I love. I suppose she won't come until they are all asleep, he thought. The night is half gone. Oh, Maria. Come now quickly, Maria, for there is little time. Suddenly he felt a panic that she might not come. Then he saw her coming. She came running, carrying something in her hands. Then she was kneeling by the robe, slapping snow from her feet. She kissed him and handed him her bundle. "Put it with your pillow," she said. "I took these off there to save time." "You came barefoot through the snow?" "Yes," she said, "and wearing only my wedding shirt." He held her close and tight in his arms and she rubbed her head against his chin. "Avoid the feet," she said. "They are very cold, Roberto." "Put them here and warm them." "No," she said. "They will warm quickly. But now say that you love me." "I love you." "Good. Good. Good." "I love you, little rabbit." "Do you love my wedding shirt?" "It is the same one as always." "Yes. As last night. It is my wedding shirt." "Take off your wedding shirt, if you won't be cold." "Cold? I am on fire." "I, too. But afterwards you won't be cold?" "No. Afterwards we will be as one animal of the forest and be so close that neither one can tell that one of us is one and not the other. Can you not feel my heart be your heart?" "Yes. There is no difference." During the night he woke and held her tight as though she were all of life and it was being taken from him. But she was sleeping well and peacefully and she did not wake. So he rolled onto his side and lay there in the night thinking. chapter EIGHT A warm wind came with daylight and he could hear the snow falling from the trees. Then he heard a horse coming, "Maria," he said, and shook the girl's shoulder to waken her. "Stay under the robe," and he buttoned his shirt with one hand and held the automatic pistol in the other. Then he saw the horseman coming through the trees. The horseman was almost opposite him now. He was riding a big gray horse and he had a young, hard face. He saw Robert Jordan and reached his hand down toward his scabbard. Aiming at the center of his chest, Robert Jordan fired. The pistol roared in the snowy woods. The horse fell and the young man slid over toward the ground, his right foot caught in the stirrup. People were coming out of the cave. Robert Jordan unrolled his trousers and began to put them on. "Get dressed," he said to Maria. Overhead he heard the noise of a plane flying very high. "Go catch that horse," he called to Primitivo. Then, "Who was on guard at the top?" "Rafael," Pilar said from the cave. She stood there, her hair still down her back in two braids. "There's cavalry out," Robert Jordan said. "Get your gun up there." He heard Pilar call, "Agustin," into the cave. Two men came running out, one with the automatic rifle on his shoulder and the other with the pans. He looked through the trees to where Primitivo was twisting the rider's foot out of the stirrup. The body lay face down in the snow and Primitivo was going through the pockets. They were all out of the cave now, standing there with the carbines and with grenades on their belts. Robert Jordan went into the cave, found his two packs and opened the one with the machine gun in it. He locked the pack and started for the door. "Andres, get the horses ready. If you hear firing bring them up to the woods behind the gap. Come with your arms and leave the women to hold the horses. Fernando, make sure that my sacks are brought." "Maria and I will prepare all for leaving," Pilar said. Pablo rode ahead and the two men followed one behind the other in order not to leave tracks in the snow. Robert Jordan looked back and saw Maria standing with Pilar. Then she came running up the trail. "Can I go with you?" "No. Help Pilar." She was walking behind him and put her hand on his arm. "I'm coming." "No," he said. "But take good care of your wedding shirt." "Kiss me," she said, "if you go." "You are shameless," he said. "Yes," she said. "Totally." He looked at her and smiled through his thinking. "When you hear firing," he said, "come with the horses. Help Pilar with my sacks." He looked back and saw her standing there in the first morning light. She turned and walked back down the trail, her head down. "Cut some pine branches," Robert Jordan said to Primitivo. "I do not like the gun there," he said to Agustin. "Why?" "Place it over there," Robert Jordan pointed, "and later I will tell you." He looked out across the narrow opening, noting the height of the rocks on either side. "The gun must be farther out. Good. Put the stones there. Leave room for the muzzle to swing." Robert Jordan watched Pablo riding down the slope and disappearing in the trees. I hope he doesn't run into cavalry, Robert Jordan thought. Primitivo brought the pine branches and Robert Jordan put them through the snow into the earth, so that they covered the gun from either side. If we can get through today without fighting we can manage the whole operation tomorrow with what we have. I know we can. If we don't have to fight today. God help us if we have to fight today. Two crows circled overhead and then settled in a pine tree below. Another crow joined them and Robert Jordan thought: those are my sentinels. As long as those are quiet there is no one coming through the trees. Agustin and Primitivo came up with the branches and Robert Jordan built a good blind that would conceal the gun from the air and would look natural from the forest. "Do not fire if you see anyone from there," Robert Jordan said. "Roll a small rock down as a warning, and signal to us with your rifle, so," he lifted the rifle and held it over his head as though guarding it. "Thus for numbers," he lifted the rifle up and down. "If they are on foot point the rifle muzzle at the ground. Do not fire from there until you hear the gun fire. Shoot at a man's knees when you shoot from that height. If you hear me whistle come to these rocks where the gun is." "I understand," Primitivo said and climbed up into the high rocks with his carbine. Robert Jordan explained to Agustin about the gun. All this time he had been watching the crows. Now one bird cawed and flew up. But the other crow still stayed in the tree. "I have a massacre for you tomorrow morning," Robert Jordan said. "It is necessary to exterminate the post at the sawmill." "I am ready," Agustin said. "Also the post at the hut below the bridge." "Both?" Agustin asked. "Not both. They will be done at the same time," Robert Jordan said. "Then for either one," Agustin said. "I have wished for action in this war." Then he heard the first sounds of a plane coming. "They cannot see us," he said to Agustin. "But it is well to keep down." As Robert Jordan looked, he saw the crow fly up. He flew away through the trees without cawing. Robert Jordan was looking ahead across the open space toward the forest. He saw nothing and heard nothing but he could feel his heart beating and then he heard the clack of stone on stone and the clicks of a small rock falling. He saw Primitive's rifle raised and lowered four times horizontally. "Cavalry," he said softly to Agustin. Robert Jordan watched them. Finally the four of them trotted into the forest where Pablo's trail led. "We would have killed all four," Agustin said quietly. "Yes," Robert Jordan whispered. "But with the firing who knows what might have come?" Just then he heard the noise of another rock falling and he looked up to where Primitivo was raising and lowering his rifle in what seemed an infinity of quick movements. Pablo has forty-five minutes' start, Robert Jordan thought, and then he heard the noise of cavalry coming. There were twenty men on horseback, armed and uniformed, and they went into the forest. "There were many," Agustin said. "We would have had to deal with them if we had destroyed the others," Robert Jordan said softly. There was a hollow feeling in his chest. "What do you think of their chance of catching Pablo?" Robert Jordan asked Agustin. "Pablo is very smart," Agustin said. "Is he as smart as they say?" "He is much smarter. If he were not smart he would have died last night. In politics and in guerilla warfare the first thing is to continue to exist. Look how he continued to exist last night." Robert Jordan knew how smart Pablo was. It was Pablo who had seen instantly all that was wrong with the orders for the destruction of the bridge. So now he dropped the matter and said to Anselmo, who had joined them, "Well, what about going into La Granja in daylight?" "It is not bad," the old man said. "How will you go?" "Above and down through the forest." "But if they catch you." "I have papers." "So have we all but you must eat the wrong ones quickly." Anselmo tapped the breast pocket of his smock. "How many times have I contemplated that," he said. "In my left breast pocket I carry our papers. In my right the fascist papers," Robert Jordan said. Now the morning was late May, the sky was high and clear and the wind blew warm on Robert Jordan's shoulders. The snow was clearing and they were eating breakfast. There were two big sandwiches of meat and cheese each. As they spoke Robert Jordan heard something. It was a noise far off that came above the sound of the warm wind in the trees. It came again. It was the precise, crackling sound of automatic rifle fire. Robert Jordan looked up at Primitivo his face looking toward them, his hand near to his ear. As he looked Primitivo pointed up the mountain toward the highest country. "They are fighting at El Sordo's," Robert Jordan said. "Then let us go to help them," Agustin said. "No," Robert Jordan said. "We stay here. Anselmo, you stay there with Agustin with the gun. He must not fire unless cavalry is actually entering. If they merely present themselves he must leave them alone as we did before. If he must fire, hold the legs of the tripod for him and hand him the pans when they are empty." Robert Jordan climbed up, over and around the boulders. Then he stood beside Primitivo who said, "They are attacking Sordo. What must we do?" "Nothing," Robert Jordan said. "We have to help them," Primitivo said. "It is impossible," Robert Jordan told him. "I have expected this all morning." "How?" "They went to steal horses last night. The snow stopped and they tracked them up there." "But we have to help them. Those are our comrades," Primitivo said. Robert Jordan put his hand on the other man's shoulder. "We can do nothing," he said. They heard the noise of hand grenades and automatic rifle fire. "They are lost," Robert Jordan said. "If we go there we are lost, too. It would be useless. Here comes the woman." Pilar was climbing up to them and breathing heavily from the climb. "How does the combat seem?" she asked. "Very bad." "Can we do anything for El Sordo?" "Nothing." "Pobre." she said. "I was fond of Sordo. Are you sure?" "Yes. I have seen much cavalry." Just then Robert Jordan heard the plane high overhead. He looked up and in the high sky it looked like the same observation plane that he had seen earlier in the morning. Now it was moving in the direction of where El Sordo was being attacked. Chapter NINE El Sordo was making his fight on a hilltop. He did not like this hill but he had had no choice. He had picked it and galloped for it, the automatic rifle heavy on his back, the horse laboring, the sack of grenades swinging against one side, the sack of automatic rifle pans banging against the other, and Joaquin and Ignacio stopping and firing to give him time to get the gun in place. There had still been snow then, the snow that had ruined them. When his horse was hit Sordo had pulled him along by the bridle as he climbed, with bullets hitting the rocks. Then he had shot him quickly, expertly, and tenderly. He fired at what came up the hill, forcing them to scatter. There were two more horses dead along the hill and three more were dead here on the hilltop. He had only succeeded in stealing three horses last night. Of the five men who had reached the hilltop three were wounded. Sordo was wounded in the calf of his leg and in two places in his left arm. He was very thirsty and he had a bad headache. As he lay waiting for the planes to come he thought of a joke in Spanish: "Hay que tomar la muerte como si fuera aspirina," which means, "You will have to take death as an aspirin." He grinned inside his pain and nausea. The five men were spread out like the points of a five-pointed star. "Sordo, when do you think the planes will come?" one man asked. "Any time," said Sordo. "Do you think they will attack again?" "Only if the planes do not come." He was in much pain. He looked up at the bright, blue early summer sky as he raised the leather wine bottle with his good arm. He was fifty-two years old and he was sure this was the last time he would see that sky. He was not at all afraid of dying but he was angry at being trapped on this hill. Dying was nothing and he had no picture or fear of it in his mind. But living was a field of grain blowing in the wind. Living was a hawk in the sky. Living was a horse between your legs. Just then someone shouted from down the slope. "Listen, bandits!" the voice came from behind the rocks. "Surrender now before the planes blow you to pieces." "Maybe the planes aren't coming," El Sordo said. "Don't answer them and do not fire." "Bandidos! Surrender now before we blow you to little pieces." "Let no one move," Sordo whispered. "Bandidos! Surrender!" the voice from behind the rocks again. Sordo grinned. This is better than aspirin, he thought. How many will we get? Can they be that foolish? Below the officer in command was speaking to the sniper. "They are surrounded. They have nothing to expect but to die." The sniper said nothing. "What do you think?" the officer asked. "Nothing," the sniper said. "For me it is a trick," the second officer said. "But if it is not? What ridicule, besieging dead men." "We have done something worse than ridiculous already," the second officer said. "Look at that slope." He looked up the slope to where the dead lay. "Bandidos!" the captain shouted suddenly, getting to his feet. "Fire, cowards, if you are alive," he shouted and stood there looking at the hilltop. "There is no one alive up there," the captain said. "You," he said to the sniper, "go up there and see." The sniper looked down and said nothing. "Why don't you go?" "I am afraid, my captain," the soldier said with dignity. "It is possible the soldier is right," the lieutenant said. "They are all dead," the captain said. "You mean our comrades on the hill?" the lieutenant said. "Don't be a fool. I tell you the Reds are dead." He stood on the gray boulder and waved both his arms and said, "Shoot me! Kill me!" On the hilltop El Sordo lay behind the dead horse and grinned. "Lieutenant," the captain said happily, "you and I will go up there." "Not me." "What?" The captain had his pistol out again. "I will go if you order me to. But under protest," Lieutenant Berrendo told the captain. "Then I will go alone," the captain said. "I smell cowards here." Holding the pistol in his right hand, he strode steadily up the slope. El Sordo lay behind the horse watching the captain come up the hill. Only one, he thought. We get only one. Look what an animal. Look at him stride forward. This one I take with me on the trip. This one coming now makes the same voyage I do. Come right along, Comrade Voyager. He pulled the trigger of the automatic rife gently. The captain lay on his face on the hillside. From the hilltop Sordo shouted, "Bandidos! Shoot me! Kill me!" Just then the others on the hill heard the first sound of the coming of the planes. El Sordo did not hear them. He felt a touch on his shoulder and he turned and saw the gray, frightened face of Joaquin and he looked where the boy was pointing and saw the three planes coming. "Help me to pull this out," he said to Joaquin and the boy dragged the automatic rifle clear from the horse and the rock. The planes were coming on steadily. "Lie on your backs to fire at them," Sordo said. "Fire ahead of them as they come. Ignacio, put the gun on Joaquin's shoulder." Joaquin began to pray. There were explosions around him. Then there was a whistle in the air and a red black roar. The earth moved under his knees and then hit him in the face and Ignacio was lying on him. The planes came back three times and bombed the hilltop but no one on the hilltop knew it. Lieutenant Berrendo walked up to the hilltop. No one was alive except the boy Joaquin, who was unconscious under the dead body of Ignacio. Lieutenant Berrendo made the sign of the cross and then shot him in the back of the head, quickly and gently. He stood on the hilltop and looked at his own dead. "Take that one, too," he said. "The one with his hands on the automatic rifle. That should be Sordo. No. Cut the head off and wrap it in a poncho. Take all the heads." Then he made the sign of the cross again and walked down the hill. He did not wish to stay to see his orders being carried out. After the planes went away Robert Jordan and Primitivo heard the firing start and his heart seemed to start again with it. Then everything was quiet again and he knew that it was over. Maria came up from the camp with a tin bucket of stewed hare with mushrooms in the rich sauce and a sack with bread, a leather wine bottle, plates, cups and spoons. "What did the aviation do?" she asked, her eyes frightened. "Bombed Sordo," Robert Jordan said. "Are they still fighting?" "No. It is over." "Oh," she said and bit her lip. "I have no appetite," Primitivo said. "Eat anyway," Robert Jordan told him. "I could not swallow food." "Take a drink of this man," Robert Jordan said and handed him the wine bottle. "Then eat." "This of Sordo has taken away desire," Primitivo said. "You eat." Maria went over to him and put her arms around his neck and kissed him. "Eat, old one," she said. "Each one should take care of his strength." Primitivo took the wine bottle and then filled his plate and began to eat. Maria sat down and put her arm around Robert Jordan's shoulder. "You may stay here, if you want," he said after the food was all eaten. "No," she said. "I must go to Pilar. She is giving me instruction." "What does she give you?" "Instruction." She smiled, kissed him and left. An hour passed when he saw them coming over the top of the hill and he picked up his binoculars. The first two riders came into sight on the slope of the high hill. Then there were four more horsemen coming down, and then he saw the double column of men and horses. Then came the horses with their burdens tied across the saddles. He could not see at that distance that one saddle had of a long rolled poncho. It carried the heads of the men. Sordo's automatic rifle was lashed on top of the saddle. Lieutenant Berrendo, who was riding at the head of the column, felt no arrogance. He felt only the hollowness that comes after action. He was thinking: taking the heads is barbarous. But proof and identification is necessary. I will have trouble enough about this. He rode out of the forest onto the yellow road that led into La Granja. It was here that Anselmo saw them ride past. He counted the dead and the wounded and he recognized Sordo's automatic rifle. He did not know what the poncho was, but when, on his way home, he came onto the hill where Sordo had fought, he knew at once what the poncho contained. 1 He walked as fast as he could to bring the news. And as he walked he prayed for the souls of Sordo and his band. It was the first time he had prayed since the start of the movement. He could not keep from thinking of the next day. So he thought: I will do exactly as the Ingles says. Help me, O Lord, tomorrow to behave as a man should in his last hours. When he had reached the upper post Fernando asked, "Who's there?" "It is I," he answered, "Anselmo." "Good," Fernando said. "You know about Sordo?" Anselmo asked Fernando. "Pablo has told us all." Robert Jordan looked up as Anselmo came in. Pablo stared straight at the table. "I come from above," Anselmo said to Robert Jordan. "Pablo has told us," Robert Jordan said. "There were six dead on the hill and they had taken the heads," Anselmo said. Robert Jordan nodded. Pablo sat there looking at the wine bowl and saying nothing. There was no expression on his face. "Sit down," Robert Jordan said to Anselmo. "What happened on the road, old one?" "There was much movement," Anselmo said. "I have it all noted down as you showed me." While Robert Jordan noted Anselmo told him everything he had seen move past him on the road. He told it from the beginning and in order with the wonderful memory of those who cannot read or write. When he finished, he said, "That is all." "It is enough," Robert Jordan said. "Who beside you has been through the lines to the side of the Republic?" "Andres and Eladio." "Which is the better of those two?" "Andres." "Then get Andres and I will write a message for him to give to General Golz. I will write it now and close it with this seal. Now go and get Andres." Robert Jordan commenced writing in his notebook. "Listen, Ingles there is no need to be disheartened. Without Sordo we have plenty of people to take the posts and blow your bridge," Pablo said. "Good," Robert Jordan said and continued writing. "Plenty," Pablo said. "I have admired your judgment much today. You are smarter than I am. I have confidence in you." Robert Jordan was hardly listening because he was concentrating on his report to Golz. He was trying to write a short report and still convince them to cancel the attack. However, he did not want them to think that he had any fears about his mission. This is my report to Golz, he thought. I do not blow the bridge until the attack starts. My orders are clear and if the attack is called off I blow nothing. So now everything had been done that there was to do that night. All orders had been given. Everyone knew exactly what he was to do in the morning. Andres had been gone three hours. Either it would come now with the coming of daylight or it would not come. I believe that it will come, Robert Jordan told himself. Don't worry, he told himself. Look at the miracles that have happened before this. Either you will have to blow that bridge in the morning or you will not have to. It is not you who decides what shall be done. You follow orders. He began thinking about his grandfather who had been such a good soldier and had fought for four years in the American Civil War. He thought about his father who had shot himself with grandfather's 32 caliber Smith and Wesson. He had forgiven his father and he had pitied him, but he was ashamed of him. You better not think at all, he told himself. Soon you will be with Maria and you won't have to think. chapter TEN So now they were in the robe again together and it was late in the last night. Maria lay close against him. "Roberto," Maria said very softy and kissed him. "I am sorry. I do not wish to disappoint you but I am not feeling very well tonight." "That is of no importance. That is a passing thing. We are together when we lie together." "Yes, but I am very sorry, Roberto." "Let us talk together. I know you very little from talking." "Should we speak of tomorrow and of your work?" "No," he said. "Let us not talk about tomorrow nor what happened today. Are you afraid?" "I am always afraid. But now I am afraid for you so much I do not think of me." "You must not, rabbit. I have been in many things. And worse than this," he lied. Then suddenly surrendering to something, to the luxury of going into unreality, he said, "Let us talk of us in Madrid." "Good," she said. He stroked her head and kissed her and relaxed beside her, listening to the quiet of the night. They talked about Madrid, imagined how it would be there and made plans for the future. Then suddenly Maria said, "Listen. Pilar told me something-" "Say it." "No. It is better not to." "What was it you were going to say?" "Pilar told me that we would all die tomorrow and that you know it as well as she does and that you give it no importance. She says this not in criticism but in admiration." "She said that?" he said. The crazy woman, he thought, and he said, "That is more of her gypsy nonsense." "Then you know no such thing?" "Of course not." But this time when he talked about Madrid there was no slipping into fantasy again. Now he was just lying to his girl and to himself to pass the night before battle and he knew it. He liked to do it, but all the luxury of the acceptance was gone. God, he had pretended a lot tonight. And Pilar had been pretending all day. Sure. What if they were killed tomorrow? What did it matter as long as they did the bridge properly? That was all they had to do tomorrow. Maybe I have had all my life in three days, he thought. He kissed Maria who did not wake. It was two o'clock in the morning when Pilar waked him. "Pablo is gone," the big woman said to him. Robert Jordan put on his trousers and shoes. Maria had not waked. "When?" he asked. "It must be an hour." "And?" "He has taken something that belongs to you," the woman said sadly. "So. What?" "I do not know," she told him. "Come and see." Robert Jordan shone the torch on the two sacks that were at the head of Pilar's bed. There was a long slit from top to bottom in each one. He felt in the first sack, and it should not be very full. It was not very full. There was some wire in it still but the wooden box of the exploder was gone. So was the box with the detonators. So was the tin with the fuse. Then he felt in the other sack. It was still full of explosive. There might be one packet missing. He stood up and turned to the woman. "I thought you were guarding my things," he said, visibly upset. "I slept with my head against them and one arm touching them," Pilar told him. "Pablo got up in the night and I said, 'Where do you go, Pablo?' 'To urinate,' he told me and I slept again. When I woke again and he was not there I worried and I felt for the sacks and found that there were the slit places and I came to you." "Come on," Robert Jordan said. They went to the meadow and found that two horses were gone. "How long ago do you think he left?" "It must have been an hour." "Then that is that," Robert Jordan said. "I'm going to get what is left of my sacks and go back to bed." "I will guard them." "You've guarded them once already." "There is nothing I would not do to bring back your property. We have both been betrayed by Pablo." Robert Jordan realized that he should not be angry. He had to work with this woman. He put his hand on her shoulder. "What is gone is of small importance. We shall improvise something that will do as well. Get some sleep, woman," he told her gently. Robert Jordan lay in the robe beside Maria who was still sleeping. He was angry with himself. You told yourself the first time you saw him that when he would be friendly would be when the treachery would come. You damned fool. Oh, the dirty, vile pig. Why was I such a fool as to leave them with that woman? The insane, egotistical pigs that have always governed Spain and ruled her armies. His anger gradually subsided as he exaggerated more and more and spread his scorn so widely that he could no longer believe in it himself. If that were true what are you here for? It's not true and you know it. He lay close to the girl now with his arms around her. 1 "It's all planned," he said softly against Maria's shoulder. "We'll be killed but we'll blow the bridge. You have not had to worry about it. Sleep well, my beloved." Andres arrived at a government position. "Don't shoot, Comrades," Andres shouted. "I want to come in." "How many are you?" someone called from behind the wall. "One. Me. Alone." "Who are you?" "Andres Lopez of Villaconejos. From the band of Pablo. With a message." "Listen, fascist." "I am not a fascist," Andres shouted. "I am a guerrillero from the band of Pablo. "He's crazy," he heard someone say. "Throw a bomb at him." "I have never heard of the band of Pablo," the man who was evidently in command said. "Put your rifle over your shoulder and use your hands to come through the wire." When he had come through the wire he showed the commanding officer his papers. He examined them carefully. "I have orders to deliver this message to the General commanding the Thirty-Fifty Division, which makes an attack at daylight in these hills and it is already late at night and I must go." "What attack?" "I know nothing." "I distrust all of this greatly," the commanding officer said. "I will go with you myself to the Commander." "Good," Andres said. "But we should go quickly." They went on down the hill in the dark. Robert Jordan lay with the girl and he watched time passing on his wrist watch. The morning would be coming fast now in this month. It was time to rise. "Roberto," Maria said. "Yes, guapa." "Will we be together today?" "After the start, yes." "Not at the start?" "No. You will be with the horses." "But you will come fast when it is done?" "Very fast," he said and grinned in the dark. "Come, let us go and eat." In the cave Pilar had coffee ready in a pot. She was repairing the hole in one of Jordan's packs. The men drank their coffee and were nervous. "Are you going to be throwing bombs, Ingles?" Agustin asked. "Why not?" Robert Jordan said. But crouched there, sorting out the grenades, what he was thinking was: it is impossible. How could I have deceived myself? We were as defeated when they attacked Sordo as Sordo was defeated when the snow stopped. It is that you can't accept it. You have to go on and make a plan that you know is impossible to carry out. You made it and now you know it is no good. You can take either of the posts with what you've got here. But you can't take them both. Pablo knew that all the time. You can't base an operation on the hope that a miracle will happen. Do you suppose there will be a miracle and Golz will get the message from Andres and stop it? If there isn't, you are going to kill them all with those orders. Maria too. It was a night plan and it's morning. Night plans aren't any good in the morning. Take it easy, he told himself. There are always ways out. Pilar came over to him with the bag of grenades. "How does it seem to you now that it is really starting?" "That we are few," Robert Jordan said to her quickly. "To me, too," she said. "Very few." "About that thing of the hand-" "What thing of the hand?" he said angrily. "Do not be angry. In regard to that thing of the hand. That is all gypsy nonsense that I make to give myself an importance. There is no such thing." "Leave it alone," he said coldly. "No," she said harshly and lovingly. "I care for you very much. Do not worry. We will all do very well." "Of course we will," Robert Jordan said. "When do we go?" Pilar asked. "Robert Jordan looked at his watch and said, "Any time." "Listen," Pilar began. Robert Jordan looked toward her and as he did he saw her mouth open and the unbelieving look come on her face and he reached for his pistol. There was Pablo, standing short and wide, looking toward no one in particular. "You-" Pilar said to him unbelieving. "Me," said Pablo evenly. He came into the cave. "Hola, Ingles," he said. "I have five men from the bands of Elias and Alejandro above with their horses." "And the exploder and the detonators?" Robert Jordan said. "I threw them into the river," Pablo said still looking at no one. "But I have thought of a way to detonate using a grenade." "So have I," Robert Jordan said. He turned to Robert Jordan. "At the bottom I am not a coward." But you are many other things, Robert Jordan thought. But I'm glad to see you. "I have thought much since the thing of Sordo. I believe if we must finish we must finish together. But you, Ingles, I hate you for bringing this to us." In the dark they came up the hill through the forest to the narrow pass at the top. They all had heavy loads and they climbed slowly. The horses had loads too. Ever since Pablo had said he had five men Robert Jordan felt increasingly better. Seeing Pablo again had broken the pattern of tragedy into which the whole operation had seemed destined ever since the snow. Instead of the certainty of failure he felt confidence rising in him. During the time that Robert Jordan had slept, the time he had spent planning the destruction of the bridge and the time that he had been with Maria, Andres had made slow progress. He had followed the company commander to battalion headquarters where the commander was filled with enthusiasm on hearing about his mission. This commander, who was named Gomez, cursed the company commander for his stupidity, patted Andres on the back and told him that he had always wanted to be a guerrillero. Instead of sending Andres back to brigade headquarters with the motorcyclist, Gomez had decided to take him there himself in order to expedite things. With Andres holding tight onto the seat ahead of him, they roared, bumping down the mountain road between the row of big trees. When they arrived at brigade headquarters Gomez said to a very sleepy officer, "Call the Lieutenant-Colonel. This is a matter of the utmost gravity. We have a message for General Golz who commands the attack that is to be made at dawn at Navacerrada." "He is asleep," the officer said. "Wake him up, for the love of God." The officer looked at him with his droopy eyes and said, "All of you are crazy. I know of no General Golz nor of an attack." "Wake the Lieutenant-Colonel," Gomez said and Andres saw his mouth tightening. The officer answered with an obscenity and Gomez took his pistol and held it against the officer's shoulder. "Wake him or I'll kill you." "Calm yourself," the officer said. "Wake him." The Lieutenant-Colonel Miranda, a short, gray-faced man, who had been in the army all his life, came into the room. "What brings you, Gomez?" he asked. Gomez showed him Andres's papers and the message. He looked at the message hungrily, felt the seal, tested it with his forefinger and then handed both back to Andres. "You had better take him, Gomez, on the motorcycle," the Lieutenant-Colonel said. "Write them a very strong Salvoconducto to the Estado Mayor of General Golz for me to sign and put on two seals," he said to the officer. The officer showed him what he had typed and he read it over and signed it. "You must go now quickly," he said to Gomez and Andres. He shook hands with both of them. After they went out he stood in front of the big map on the wall and studied the offensive possibilities in the country above Navacerrada. "I am glad it is Golz and not me," he said. chapter ELEVEN Pablo stopped and dismounted in the dark. Robert Jordan heard the creaking and the heavy breathing as they all dismounted. "Agustfn," Robert Jordan said in a whisper, "you and Anselmo come now with me to the bridge." "Listen, woman," he said softly. "What now?" she whispered in a low voice. "You understand that there is to be no attack on the post until you hear the falling of the bombs?" "How many times do you have to tell me?" Pilar said. "Only to check," Robert Jordan said. "And after the destruction of the post you fall back onto the bridge and cover the road from above and my left flank." "I have understood this since we were at Sordo's," Pilar whispered. Robert Jordan went to where Pablo was tying the horses. "Do you understand everything?" Robert Jordan asked. "Why not?" Pablo said. "Destroy the post. Cut the wire. Fall back on the bridge. Cover the bridge until you blow it." "And nothing to start until the commencement of the bombardment." "Thus it is." "Well, much luck," Robert Jordan said. "We all go now." Pablo said. "Suerte, Ingles." He put his hand out and said, "Suerte, Pablo," and their two hands gripped in the dark. Pablo's hand gripped his hard and pressed it frankly and he returned the grip. Robert Jordan threw his pack on his back and walked over to the horses to find Maria. "Good-by, guapa," he said. "I will see you soon." He had an unreal feeling about all of this now as though he had said it all before. "Good-by, Roberto," she said. "Take much care." Walking carefully they dropped down the steep wooded hillside to the point above the bridge where Robert Jordan and Anselmo had watched the first day. "Here is where we watched," Anselmo said. He took Robert Jordan's hand to touch a small fresh blaze on the tree trunk. "To the right is where you wanted to put the maquina." "We will place it there. From here, with daylight," Robert Jordan whispered to Agustin, "you will see a small stretch of road and the entrance to the bridge. Here you will lie while we prepare the exploding and fire on anything that comes from above or below." Anselmo and Robert Jordan left Agustin there and went back to where the packs were. "Where had we best leave them?" Robert Jordan whispered. "I think here." "Is this exactly where we were on that day?" "The same tree," Anselmo said. "It is close enough. We are all right here." "Then I will go now to cross the gorge and be in position at the other end," Anselmo said. "Until soon, Ingles." "Until soon, old one," Robert Jordan said. He lay on the pine-needle floor of the forest and waited for daylight. During the time Pablo had ridden back from the hills to the cave and by the time the band had dropped down to where they had left the horses, Andres had made rapid progress toward Golz's headquarters. The motorcycle went fast, swooping along the road that mounted steadily toward the mountain. As they neared the top Gomez told him to get down and together they pushed the motorcycle up the last steep grade of the pass. At the left, just past the top, there was a big stone building. "Let us go to ask where the headquarters is," Gomez said to Andres. At the door Gomez spoke to one of the sentries. "Captain Gomez of the Sixty-Fifth Brigade," he said. "Can you tell me where to find the headquarters of General Golz?" The sentry opened the door. "Call the corporal," he shouted inside. Just then a big staff car came toward them and stopped outside the door. A large man, old and heavy, in an oversized khaki beret got out of the car. He spoke in French. Gomez knew this man's high political place in the International Brigades and he knew this man would know where Golz's headquarters were. He did not know what this man had become with time, disappointment and thwarted ambition. Knowing nothing of this Gomez stepped forward, saluted and said, "Comrade Marty, we are the bearers of a message for General Golz. Can you direct us to his headquarters? It is urgent." "You have what, Comrade?" he asked Gomez. "A message for General Golz." Andre Marty glanced at the message and the other papers and put them in his pocket. "Arrest them both," he said to the corporal. "What is wrong with that man?" Gomez said to one of the guards. "He is crazy," the guard said. "I thought he was a great French figure," Gomez said. "He may be a glory and all, but he is crazy. He has a mania for shooting people." It is doubtful if the outcome of Andres's mission would have been different if he and Gomez had been allowed to proceed without Marty's obstruction. There was no one at the front with sufficient authority to cancel the attack. On this night, Marty was still sitting at the table with his map when the door opened and Karkov the Russian journalist came in with two other Russians. Marty did not like Karkov, but Karkov was at this moment one of the three most important men in Spain. When Karkov heard of the message coming through for Golz from a partizan group that involved his American comrade Jordan, he immediately ordered Marty to give him the message and sent Andres and Gomez to Golz's headquarters. Andres and Gomez were on the motorcycle and on the road again. When they reached Golz's headquarters, however, the first sound of the planes was heard. Duvall, Golz's Chief of Staff, read the message, and felt sweat come out from his armpit and run down his flank. He was able to give the message to Golz on the phone, but it was too late. Golz knew that once they had passed overhead the bombs would fall. He watched the planes with his hard proud eyes that knew how things could be and how they would be instead. Robert Jordan lay behind the trunk of a pine tree and looked at the structure of the bridge. He looked at his watch and wondered if Andres got through to Golz. And if he did would they cancel it? We should have portable short-wave sets, though. Robert Jordan looked down to the sentry box. Then he heard the sudden noise of the bombs falling. The man in the sentry box stood up when he heard the bombs and reached for his rifle. Robert Jordan felt his own breath tight now as he aimed at the man's chest and squeezed the trigger. Then he heard Anselmo shoot. Robert Jordan picked up the two heavy packs, ran onto the bridge and started climbing down into the framework. "Hand me a package at a time," he called up to Anselmo, who leaned far over the edge handing down the blocks of explosive that Robert Jordan placed where he wanted them. "Give me some more, Anselmo," he said. The old man nodded. "Almost finished," Robert Jordan said. "Give me the big coil of wire." The old man handed it down. Then Robert Jordan climbed up onto the bridge, took the coil from the old man and walked back as fast as he could. Then he handed it to Anselmo. "Take this back to that high stone," he said. "Hold it easily but firmly. When you pull hard, hard, the bridge will blow. Comprendes?" "Yes." "When you pull, really pull. Do not jerk." While Robert Jordan spoke he was looking up the road at the remainder of Pilar's band. He saw Primitivo and Rafael supporting Fernando who had been shot. Then they all heard firing start down the road where Pablo was holding the post he had taken. Robert Jordan heard the firing and as he walked he felt it in the pit of his stomach. Now he was almost opposite Anselmo's stone and it was still clear below the bridge. Then he heard the truck coming down the road and he saw it over his shoulder and he swung his wrist once around the wire and shouted to Anselmo, "Blow her!" and he dug his heels in and leaned back hard onto the tension of the wire, and then there was a cracking roar and the middle of the bridge rose up in the air like a wave breaking and he felt the blast from the explosion roll back against him as he dove on his face with his hands holding tight over his head. His face was down against the pebbles as the bridge settled where it had risen and the familiar yellow smell of it rolled over him in acrid smoke and then it started to rain pieces of steel. After the steel stopped falling he was still alive and he raised his head and looked across the bridge. The center section was gone. Anselmo lay face down behind the white marking stone. The loop of wire was still around his right fist. Robert Jordan crossed the road, knelt by him and made sure that he was dead. He was dead and that was all. Robert Jordan was coughing from the TNT fumes and felt numb all through himself. Now it was over he was lonely, detached and elated and he hated everyone he saw. Just then they heard the planes. They all looked up and the planes were coming from Segovia very high in the sky. Lying there, by Agustin, watching the planes going over, listening for firing behind him, watching the road below where he knew he would see something but not what it would be, he still felt numb with the surprise that he had not been killed at the bridge. He had accepted being killed so completely that all of this now seemed unreal. If things had been unreal before, they were suddenly real enough now. A tank started to fire down the road. "Is that the famous tank, Ingles?" Agustin asked. "That's a baby one." Just then Agustin saw Pablo coming over the edge of the gorge, his face running with sweat. Robert Jordan looked, saw Pablo, and then he started firing at the tank. The little tank moved quickly out of sight. "Bring the pans and the gun," he shouted, "and come running." Robert Jordan ran up the hill. Agustin was close behind him and behind him Pablo was coming. "Pilar!" Robert Jordan shouted. "Come on!" The three of them were going as fast as they could up the steep slope. "And your people?" Agustin said to Pablo. "All dead," Pablo said. "We have plenty of horses now." "Good," Robert Jordan said. The murderous bastard, he thought. Robert Jordan saw Maria and the next thing he was holding her tight, with the automatic rifle leaning against his side. Then he said, "Mount. Get on that horse, guapa." Robert Jordan was on the big gray he had first seen in the snow of the morning of the day before. They all rode down through the timber toward the edge of the road. Robert Jordan rode just behind Maria. As he rode he could hear guns firing. "Come on, you big gray fascist bastard," he said to the horse and put him down the slope in a sliding plunge. Then he was out in the open. He saw them all ahead in the edge of the forest watching him and he said, "Go on, horse!" and felt his big horse's chest surging as he went up the slope and saw the gray neck stretching, and he looked back at the bridge and saw the bright flash from the tank on the road and then he heard only a banging acrid smelling noise like a boiler being ripped apart and he was under the gray horse and the gray horse was kicking and he was trying to pull out from under the weight. He could move toward the right. But his left leg stayed perfectly flat under the horse as he moved to the right. It was as though there was a new joint in it; not the hip joint but another one that went sideways. Primitivo and Agustin pulled him up the last slope to the timber where Maria, Pilar and Pablo were standing. Maria was kneeling by him and saying, "Roberto, what is it?" He said, sweating heavily, "The left leg is broken, guapa." "We will bind it up," Pilar said. "You can ride that." She pointed to one of the horses. Robert Jordan saw Pablo shake his head and he nodded at him. "Pablo, come here. I have to speak to Pablo," he said to Pilar and Maria. "Does it hurt much?" Pablo asked. "No. I think the nerve is crushed. Listen. I am mucked, see? I will talk to the girl for a moment. When I say to take her, take her. She will want to stay. I will only speak to her for a moment." "Clearly, there is not much time," Pablo said. "I am sorry you have this, Ingles." "Slit the trouser, please," he said to Pilar. Maria crouched by him and did not speak. Her face was twisted as a child's contorts before it cries. But she was not crying. Pilar took her knife and slit his left trouser leg. Ten inches below the hip joint there was a pointed, purple swelling like a little tent and as he touched it with his fingers he could feel the snapped-off thigh bone tight against the skin. His leg was lying at an odd angle. He looked up at Pilar. "Anda," he said to her. "Go." She went away without saying anything nor looking back and Robert Jordan could see her shoulders shaking. "Guapa," he said to Maria and took hold of her hands. "Listen. We will not be going to Madrid-" Then she started to cry. "No, don't," he said. "We will not go to Madrid now but I will always go with you where you go. As long as there is one of us there is both of us. Understand?" "No, I stay with you." "No, rabbit. What I do now I do alone. I could not do it well with you. If you go then I go with you. It is in that way that I go too." "But it is easier if I stay with you," she said. "It is worse for me to go." "Surely," he said. "It is harder for you. But I am you also now." He looked at her and he was sweating heavily. "Now you will go for us both," he said. "You must not be selfish, rabbit. You must do your duty now. You are me now." "No," she said and held him tight around the neck. He now spoke calmly and reasonably but with great authority. "Stand up," he said. "You are all there will be of me. Stand up." She stood up slowly, crying. Pilar was holding her by the arm. "Vamonos," Pilar said. "You do not need anything, Ingles?" "No," he said and went on talking to Maria. "There is no good-by, because we are not apart," he spoke calmly as Pilar walked the girl along. "Get her in the saddle," he said to Pilar. "Now go." She started to look around. "Don't look around," Robert Jordan said. "Go." They were all out of sight. He felt empty and drained and exhausted from all of it and from them going and his mouth tasted of bile. Now, finally and at last, there was no problem. Pilar will take care of her as well as anyone can. It does no good to think about Maria. Try to believe what you told her. He looked down the hill slope and thought, I hate to leave it, is all. I hate to leave it very much and I hope I have done some good in it. I wish they would come now, he said, because the leg is starting to hurt now. It must be the swelling. Oh, let them come, he said. I don't want to do that business that my father did. I will do it all right but I'd much prefer not to have to. I'm against that. I can't wait any longer now, he said. If I wait any longer I'll pass out. It would be all right to do it now. And if you wait and hold them up even a little while or just get the officer that may make all the difference. All right, he said. He lay very quietly and tried to hold on to himself that he felt slipping away. Let me last until they come, he said quietly. As the officer came trotting now on the trail he would pass twenty yards below where Robert Jordan lay. At that distance there would be no problem. The officer was Lieutenant Berrendo. Robert Jordan lay behind the tree. He was waiting until the officer reached the sunlit place. He could feel his heart beating against the pine-needle floor of the forest. They started two hours before daylight, and at first, it was not necessary to break the ice across the canal as other boats had gone on ahead. In each boat, in the darkness, so you could not see, but only hear him, the poler stood in the stern, with his long oar. The shooter sat on a shooting stool fastened to the top of a box that contained his lunch and shells, and the shooter's two, or more, guns were propped against the load of wooden decoys. Somewhere, in each boat, there was a sack with one or two live mallard hens, or a hen and a drake, and in each boat there was a dog who shifted and shivered uneasily at the sound of the wings of the ducks that passed overhead in the darkness. Four of the boats went on up the main canal towards the big lagoon to the north. A fifth boat had already turned off into a side canal. Now, the sixth boat turned south into a shallow lagoon, and there was no broken water. It was all ice, new-frozen during the sudden, windless cold of the night. It was rubbery and bending against the thrust of the boatman's oar. Then it would break as sharply as a pane of glass, but the boat made little forward progress. 'Give me an oar,' the shooter in the sixth boat said. He stood up and braced himself carefully. He could hear the ducks passing in the darkness, and feel the restless lurching of the dog. To the north he heard the sound of breaking ice from the other boats. 'Be careful,' the poler in the stern said. 'Don't tip the boat over.' 'I am a boatman, too,' the shooter said. He took the long oar the boatman handed him and reversed it so he could hold it by the blade. Holding the blade he reached forward and punched the handle through the ice. He felt the firm bottom of the shallow lagoon, put his weight on the top of the wide oar-blade, and holding with both hands and, first pulling, then shoving, until the pole-hold was well to the stern, he drove the boat ahead to break the ice. The ice broke like sheets of plate glass as the boat drove into it, and onto it, and astern the boatman shoved them ahead into the broken passage. After a while, the shooter, who was working hard and steadily and sweating in his heavy clothes, asked the boatman, 'Where is the shooting barrel?' 'Off there to the left. In the middle of the next bay.' 'Should I turn for it now?' 'As you wish.' 'What do you mean, as I wish? You know the water. Is there water to carry us there?' 'The tide is low. Who knows?' 'It will be daylight before we get there if we don't hurry.' The boatman did not answer. All right, you surly jerk, the shooter thought to himself. We are going to get there. We've made two-thirds of the way now and if you are worried about having to work to break ice to pick up birds, that is altogether too bad. 'Get your back in it, jerk,' he said in English. 'What?' the boatman asked in Italian. 'I said let's go. It's going to be light.' It was daylight before they reached the oaken-staved hogshead sunk in the bottom of the lagoon. It was surrounded by a sloping rim of earth that had been planted with sedge and grass, and the shooter swung carefully up onto this, feeling the frozen grasses break as he stepped on them. The boatman lifted the combination shooting stool and shell box out of the boat and handed it to the shooter, who leaned over and placed it in the bottom of the big barrel. The shooter, wearing his hip boots and an old combat jacket, with a patch on the left shoulder that no one understood, and with the slight light places on the straps, where stars had been removed, climbed down into the barrel and the boatman handed him his two guns. He placed them against the wall of the barrel and hung his other shell bag between them, hanging it on two hooks built into the wall of the sunken barrel. Then he leaned the guns against each side of the shell bag. 'Is there water?' he asked the boatman. 'No water,' the boatman said. 'Can you drink the lagoon water?' 'No. It is unhealthy.' The shooter was thirsty from the hard work of breaking the ice and driving the boat in and he felt his anger rise, and then held it, and said, 'Can I help you in the boat to break ice to put out the decoys?' 'No,' the boatman said and shoved the boat savagely out on to the thin sheet ice that cracked and ripped as the boat drove up on to it. The boatman commenced smashing at the ice with the blade of his oar and then started tossing decoys out to the side and behind him. He's in a beautiful mood, the shooter thought. He's a big brute, too. I worked like a horse coming out here. He just pulled his weight and that's all. What the hell is eating him? This is his trade, isn't it? He arranged the shooting stool so he would have the maximum swing to left and right, opened a box of shells, and filled his pockets and opened another of the boxes of shells in the shell bag so he could reach into it easily. In front of him, where the lagoon lay glazed in the first light, was the black boat and the tall, heavily built boatman smashing with his oar at the ice and tossing decoys overboard as though he were ridding himself of something obscene. It was getting lighter now and the shooter could see the low line of the near point across the lagoon. Beyond that point he knew there were two other shooting posts and far beyond it there was more marsh and then the open sea. He loaded both his guns and checked the position of the boat that was putting out decoys. From behind him, he heard the incoming whisper of wings and he crouched, took hold of his right-hand gun with his right hand as he looked up from under the rim of the barrel, then stood to shoot at the two ducks that were dropping down, their wings set to brake, coming down dark to the grey dim sky, slanting towards the decoys. His head low, he swung the gun on a long slant, down, well and ahead of the second duck, then without looking at the result of his shot he raised the gun smoothly, up, up ahead and to the left of the other duck that was climbing to the left and as he pulled, saw it fold in flight and drop among the decoys in the broken ice. He looked to his right and saw the first duck a black patch on the same ice. He knew he had shot carefully on the first duck, far to the right of where the boat was and on the second, high out and to the left, letting the duck climb far up and to the left to be sure the boat was out of any line of fire. It was a lovely double, shot exactly as he should have shot, with complete consideration and respect for the position of the boat and he felt very good as he reloaded. 'Listen,' the man in the boat called. 'Don't shoot towards the boat.' I'll be a sad son of a bitch, the shooter said to himself. I will indeed. 'Get your decoys out,' he called to the man in the boat. 'But get them out fast. I won't shoot until they are all out. Except straight overhead.' The man in the boat said nothing that could be heard. I can't figure it, the shooter thought to himself. He knows the game. He knows I split the work, or more, coming out. I never shot a safer or more careful duck in my life than that. What's the matter with him? I offered to put the dekes out with him. The hell with him. Out on the right now, the boatman was still chopping angrily at the ice and tossing out the wooden decoys in a hatred that showed in every move he made. Don't let him spoil it, the shooter told himself. There won't be much shooting with this ice unless the sun should melt it later on, You probably will only have a few birds, so don't let him spoil it for you. You don't know how many more times you will shoot ducks and do not let anything spoil it for you. He watched the sky lightening beyond the long point of marsh and turning in the sunken barrel, he looked out across the frozen lagoon and the marsh and saw the snow-covered mountains a long way off. Low as he was, no foot-hills showed and the mountains rose abruptly from the plain. As he looked towards the mountains he could feel a breeze on his face and he knew, then, the wind would come from there, rising with the sun and that some birds would surely come flying in from the sea when the wind disturbed them. The boatman had finished putting out the decoys. They were in two bunches, one straight ahead and to the left towards where the sun would rise and the other to the shooter's right. Now he dropped over the hen mallard with her string and anchor and the calling duck bobbed her head under water and raising and dipping her head, splashed water on to her back. 'Don't you think it would be good to break more ice around the edges?' the shooter called to the boatman. 'There's not much water to attract them.' The boatman said nothing but commenced to smash at the jagged perimeter of ice with his oar. This ice breaking was unnecessary and the boatman knew it. But the shooter did not know it and he thought, I do not understand him but I must not let him ruin it. I must keep it entire and not let him do it. Every time you shoot now can be the last shoot and no stupid son of a bitch should be allowed to ruin it. Keep your temper, boy, he told himself. Chapter II But he was not a boy. He was fifty and a Colonel of Infantry in the Army of the United States and to pass a physical examination that he had to take the day before he came down to Venice for this shoot, he had taken enough mannitol hexanitrate to, well he did not quite know what toâ€”to pass, he said to himself. The surgeon had been quite sceptical. But he noted the readings after taking them twice. 'You know, Dick,' he said. 'It isn't indicated; in fact it is definitely contra-indicated in increased intra-colour and intra-cranial pressure.' 'I don't know what you are talking about,' the shooter, who was not a shooter, then, except potentially and was a Colonel of Infantry in the Army of the United States, reduced from being a general officer, said. 'I have known you a long time, Colonel. Or maybe it just seems a long time,' the surgeon told him. 'It's been a long time,' the Colonel said. 'We sound like song writers,' the surgeon said. 'But don't you ever run into anything, or let any sparks strike you, when you're really souped up on nitroglycerin. They ought to make you drag a chain like a high-octane truck.' 'Wasn't my cardiograph O.K.?' the Colonel asked. 'Your cardiograph was wonderful, Colonel. It could have been that of a man of twenty-five. It might have been that of a boy of nineteen.' 'Then what are you talking about?' the Colonel asked. That much mannitol hexanitrate produced a certain amount of nausea, sometimes, and he was anxious for the interview to terminate. He was also anxious to lie down and take a seconal. I ought to write the manual of minor tactics for the heavy pressure platoon, he thought. Wish I could tell him that. Why don't I just throw myself on the mercy of the court? You never do, he told himself. You always plead them non-guilty. 'How many times have you been hit in the head?' the surgeon asked him. 'You know,' the Colonel told him. 'It's in my 201.' 'How many times have you been hit on the head?' 'Oh Christ.' Then he said. 'You are asking for the army or as my physician?' 'As your physician. You didn't think I'd try to wind your clock, did you?' 'No, Wes. I'm sorry. Just what was it you wanted to know?' 'Concussions.' 'Real ones?' 'Any time you were cold or couldn't remember afterwards.' 'Maybe ten,' the Colonel said. 'Counting polo. Give or take three.' 'You poor old son of a bitch,' the surgeon said. 'Colonel, sir,' he added. 'Can I go now?' the Colonel asked. 'Yes, sir,' the surgeon said. 'You're in good shape.' 'Thanks,' the Colonel said. 'Want to go on a duck shoot down in the marshes at the mouth of the Tagliamento? Wonderful shoot. Some nice Italian kids I met up at Cortina own it.' 'Is that where they shoot coots?' 'No. They shoot real ducks at this one. Good kids. Good shoot. Real ducks. Mallard, pin-tail, widgeon. Some geese. Just as good as at home when we were kids.' 'I was kids in 'twenty-nine and 'thirty.' 'That's the first mean thing I ever heard you say.' 'I didn't mean it like that. I just meant I didn't remember when duck shooting was good. I'm a city boy, too.' 'That's the only God-damn trouble with you, too. I never saw a city boy yet that was worth a damn.' 'You don't mean that, do you, Colonel?' 'Of course not. You know damn well I don't.' 'You're in good shape, Colonel,' the surgeon said. 'I'm sorry I can't go on the shoot. I can't even shoot.' 'Hell,' said the Colonel. 'That doesn't make any difference. Neither can anybody else in this army. I'd like to have you around.' 'I'll give you something else to back up what you're using.' 'Is there anything?' 'Not really. They're working on stuff, though.' 'Let 'em work,' the Colonel said. 'I think that's a laudable attitude, sir.' 'Go to hell,' the Colonel said. 'You sure you don't want to go?' 'I get my ducks at Longchamps on Madison Avenue,' the surgeon said. 'It's air-conditioned in the summer and it's warm in the winter and I don't have to get up before first light and wear long-horned underwear.' 'All right, City Boy. You'll never know.' 'I never wanted to know,' the surgeon said. 'You're in good shape, Colonel, sir.' 'Thanks,' said the Colonel and went out. Chapter III That was the day before yesterday. Yesterday he had driven down from Trieste to Venice along the old road that ran from Montfalcone to Latisana and across the flat country. He had a good driver and he relaxed completely in the front seat of the car and looked out at all this country he had known when he was a boy. It looks quite differently now, he thought. I suppose it is because the distances are all changed. Everything is much smaller when you are older. Then, too, the roads are better now and there is no dust. The only times I used to ride through it was in a camion. The rest of the times we walked. I suppose what I looked for then, was patches of shade when we fell out, and wells in farmyards. And ditches, too, he thought. I certainly looked for plenty of ditches. They made a curve and crossed the Tagliamento on a temporary bridge. It was green along the banks and men were fishing along the far shore where it ran deep. The blown bridge was being repaired with a snarl of riveting hammers, and eight hundred yards away the smashed buildings and outbuildings of what was now a ruined country house once built by Longhena showed where the mediums had dropped their loads. 'Look at it,' the driver said. 'In this country you find a bridge or a railway station. Then go half a mile from it in any direction and you find it like that.' 'I guess the lesson is,' the Colonel said, 'don't ever build yourself a country house, or a church, or hire Giotto to paint you any frescoes, if you've got a church, eight hundred yards away from any bridge.' 'I knew there must be a lesson in it, sir,' the driver said. They were past the ruined villa now and on to the straight road with the willows growing by the ditches still dark with winter, and the fields full of mulberry trees. Ahead a man was pedalling a bicycle and using both his hands to read a paper. 'If there are heavies the lesson ought to say a mile,' the driver said. 'Would that be about right, sir?' 'If it's guided missiles,' the Colonel said. 'Better make it two hundred and fifty miles. Better give that cyclist some horn.' The driver did, and the man moved over to the side of the road without either looking up or touching his handlebars. As they passed him, the Colonel tried to see what paper he was reading, but it was folded over. 'I guess a man would do better now not to build himself a fine house or a church, or to get who did you say it was to paint frescoes?' 'Giotto, I said. But it could be Piero della Francesca or Mantegna. Could be Michelangelo.' 'Do you know a lot about painters, sir?' the driver asked. They were on a straight stretch of road now and were making time so that one farm blended, almost blurred, into another farm and you could only see what was far ahead and moving towards you. Lateral vision was just a condensation of flat, low country in the winter. I'm not sure I like speed, the Colonel thought. Brueghel would have been in a hell of a shape if he had to look at the country like this. 'Painters?' he answered the driver. 'I know quite a little about them, Burnham.' 'I'm Jackson, sir. Burnham's up at the rest centre at Cortina. That's a fine place, sir.' 'I'm getting stupid,' the Colonel said. 'Excuse me, Jackson. It is a fine place. Good chow. Well run. Nobody bothers you.' 'Yes, sir,' Jackson agreed. 'Now the reason I asked you about painters, is these madonnas. I thought I ought to see some painting so I went to that big place in Florence.' 'The Uffizi? The Pitti?' 'Whatever they call it. The biggest one. And I kept looking at those paintings until madonnas started to run out of my ears. I tell you, Colonel, sir, a man who hasn't been checked out on this painting can only see just about so many madonnas and it gets him. You know my theory? You know how crazy they are about bambinis and the less they got to eat the more bambinis they got and that they have coming? Well, I think these painters were probably big bambini lovers like all Italians. I don't know these ones you mentioned just now, so I don't include them in my theory and you'll put me straight anyway. But it looks to me like these madonnas, that I really saw plenty of, sir, it looks to me like these just straight ordinary madonna painters were sort of a manifest, say, of this whole bambini business, if you understand what I mean.' 'Plus the fact that they were restricted to religious subjects.' 'Yes, sir. Then you think there is something to my theory?' 'Sure. I think it is a little more complicated, though.' 'Naturally, sir. It's just my preliminary theory.' 'Do you have any other theories on art, Jackson?' 'No, sir. That bambini theory is as far as I've thought it through. What I wish is, though, they would paint some good pictures of that high country up around the rest centre at Cortina.' 'Titian came from up there,' the Colonel said. 'At least they say he did. I went down the valley and saw the house where he was supposed to be born.' 'Was it much of a place, sir?' 'Not so much.' 'Well, if he painted any pictures of that country up around there, with those sunset colour rocks and the pines and the snow and all the pointed steeplesâ€”â€”' 'Campaniles,' the Colonel said. 'Like that one ahead at Ceggia. It means bell tower.' 'Well, if he painted any really good pictures of that country I'd sure as hell like to trade him out of some of them.' 'He painted some wonderful women,' the Colonel said. 'If I had a joint or a roadhouse or some sort of an inn, say, I could use one of those,' the driver said. 'But if I brought home a picture of some woman, my old woman would run me from Rawlins to Buffalo. I'd be lucky if I got to Buffalo.' 'You could give it to the local museum.' 'All they got in the local museum is arrow heads, war bonnets, scalping knives, different scalps, petrified fish, pipes of peace, photographs of Liver Eating Johnston, and the skin of some bad man that they hanged him and some doctor skinned him out. One of those women pictures would be out of place there.' 'See that next campanile down there across the plain?' the Colonel said. 'I'll show you a place down there where we used to fight when I was a kid.' 'Did you fight here, too, sir?' 'Yeah,' the Colonel said. 'Who had Trieste in that war?' 'The Krauts. The Austrians, I mean.' 'Did we ever get it?' 'Not till the end when it was over.' 'Who had Florence and Rome?' 'We did.' 'Well, I guess you weren't so damned bad off then.' 'Sir,' the Colonel said gently. 'I'm sorry, sir,' the driver said quickly. 'I was in the Thirty-Sixth Division, sir.' 'I've seen the patch.' 'I was thinking about the Rapido, sir, I didn't mean to be insolent or lacking in respect.' 'You weren't,' the Colonel said. 'You were just thinking about the Rapido. Listen, Jackson, everybody who's soldiered a long time has had their Rapidos and more than one.' 'I couldn't take more than one, sir.' The car went through the cheerful town of San Dona di Piave. It was built up and new, but no more ugly than a middle western town, and it was as prosperous and as cheery as Fossalta, just up the river, is miserable and gloomy, the Colonel thought. Did Fossalta never get over the first war? I never saw it before it was smacked, he thought. They shelled it badly before the big fifteenth of June offensive in 'eighteen. Then we shelled it really badly before we re-took it. He remembered how the attack had taken off from Monastier, gone through Fornace, and on this winter day he remembered how it had been that summer. A few weeks ago he had gone through Fossalta and had gone out along the sunken road to find the place where he had been hit, out on the river bank. It was easy to find because of the bend of the river, and where the heavy machine gun post had been the crater was smoothly grassed. It had been cropped, by sheep or goats, until it looked like a designed depression in a golf course. The river was slow and a muddy blue here, with reeds along the edges, and the Colonel, no one being in sight, squatted low, and looking across the river from the bank where you could never show your head in daylight, relieved himself in the exact place where he had determined, by triangulation, that he had been badly wounded thirty years before. 'A poor effort,' he said aloud to the river and the river bank that were heavy with autumn quiet and wet from the fall rains. 'But my own. He stood up and looked around. There was no one in sight and he had left the car down the sunken road in front of the last and saddest rebuilt house in Fossalta. 'Now I'll complete the monument,' he said to no one but the dead, and he took an old Solingen clasp knife, such as German poachers carry, from his pocket. It locked on opening and, twirling it, he dug a neat hole in the moist earth. He cleaned the knife on his right combat boot and then inserted a brown ten thousand lira note in the hole and tamped it down and put the grass that he had cored out over it. 'That is twenty years at five hundred lira a year for the Medaglia d'Argento al Valore Militare. The V.C. carries ten guineas, I believe. The D.S.C. is non-productive. The Silver Star is free. I'll keep the change,' he said. It's fine now, he thought. It has merde, money, blood; look how that grass grows; and the iron's in the earth along with Gino's leg, both of Randolfo's legs and my right knee-cap. It's a wonderful monument. It has everything. Fertility, money, blood and iron. Sounds like a nation. Where fertility, money, blood and iron is; there is the fatherland. We need coal though. We ought to get some coal. Then he looked across the river to the rebuilt white house that had once been rubble, and he spat in the river. It was a long spit and he just made it. 'I couldn't spit that night nor afterwards for a long time,' he said. 'But I spit good now for a man who doesn't chew.' He walked slowly back to where the car was parked. The driver was asleep. 'Wake up, son,' he had said. 'Turn her around and take that road towards Treviso. We don't need a map on this part. I'll give you the turns.' Chapter IV Now, on his way into Venice, keeping strictly controlled and unthinking his great need to be there, the big Buick cleared the last of San Dona and came up on to the bridge over the Piave. They crossed the bridge and were on the Italian side of the river and he saw the old sunken road again. It was as smooth and undistinguished now, as it was all along the river. But he could see the old positions. And now, along each side of the straight, flat, canal-bordered road they were making time on were the willows of the two canals that had contained the dead. There had been a great killing at the last of the offensive and someone, to clear the river bank positions and the road in the hot weather, had ordered the dead thrown into the canals. Unfortunately, the canal gates were still in the Austrians' hands down the river, and they were closed. So there was little movement to the water, and the dead had stayed, there a long time, floating and bloating face up and face down regardless of nationality until they had attained colossal proportions. Finally, after organization had been established, labour troops hauled them out at night and buried them close to the road. The Colonel looked for added greenness close to the road but could not note any. However, there were many ducks and geese in the canals, and men were fishing in them all along the road. They dug them all up anyway, the Colonel thought, and buried them in that big ossario up by Nervesa. 'We fought along here when I was a kid,' the Colonel told the driver. 'It's a God-damn flat country to fight in,' the driver said. 'Did you hold that river?' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'We held it and lost it and took it back again.' 'There isn't a contour here as far as you can see.' 'That was the trouble,' the Colonel said. 'You had to use contours you couldn't see, they were so small, and ditches and houses and canal banks and hedgerows. It was like Normandy only flatter. I think it must have been something like fighting in Holland.' 'That river sure doesn't look anything like the Rapido.' 'It was a pretty good old river,' the Colonel said. 'Up above, it had plenty of water then, before all these hydro-electric projects. And it had very deep and tricky channels in the pebbles and shingle when it was shallow.' He knew how boring any man's war is to any other man, and he stopped talking about it. They always take it personally, he thought. No one is interested in it, abstractly, except soldiers and there are not many soldiers. You make them and the good ones are killed, and above they are always bucking for something so hard they never look or listen. They are always thinking of what they have seen and while you are talking they are thinking of what they will say and what it may lead to in their advancement or their privilege. There was no sense boring this boy, who, for all his combat infantryman badge, his Purple Heart and the other things he wore, was in no sense a soldier but only a man placed, against his will, in uniform, who had elected to remain in the army for his own ends. 'What did you do in civil life, Jackson?' he asked. 'I was partners with my brother in a garage in Rawlins, Wyoming, sir. 'Are you going back there?' 'My brother got killed in the Pacific and the guy who was running the garage was no good,' the driver said. 'We lost what we had put in it.' 'That's bad,' the Colonel said. 'You're God-damned right it's bad,' the driver said and added, 'sir'. The Colonel looked up the road. He knew that if they kept on this road they would come, shortly, to the turn that he was waiting for; but he was impatient. 'Keep your eyes open and take a left hand turn on the road leading off this pike,' he told the driver. 'Do you think those low roads will be good with this big car, sir?' 'We'll see,' the Colonel said. 'Hell, man, it hasn't rained in three weeks.' 'I don't trust those side roads in this low country.' 'If we get stuck, I'll haul you out with oxen.' 'I was only thinking about the car, sir.' 'Well, think about what I told you and turn off on the first left side road you see if it looks practicable.' 'That looks like one coming up, from the hedges,' the driver said. 'You're all clear behind. Pull up just ahead of it and I'll go over and have a look.' He stepped out of the car and walked across the wide, hard-surfaced road and looked at the narrow dirt road, with the swift flowing canal beside it, and the thick hedge beyond. Beyond the hedge, he saw a low red farmhouse with a big barn. The road was dry. There were not even cart ruts sunk in it. He got back into the car. 'It's a boulevard,' he said. 'Quit worrying.' 'Yes, sir. It's your car, sir.' 'I know,' the Colonel said. 'I'm still paying for it. Say, Jackson, do you always suffer so much any time you go off a highway on to a secondary road?' 'No, sir. But there's a lot of difference between a jeep, and a car as low hung as this. Do you know the clearance you have on your differential and your body frame on this?' 'I've got a shovel in the truck and we've got chains. Wait till you see where we're going after we leave Venice.' 'Do we go all the way in this car?' 'I don't know. I'll see.' 'Think about your fenders, sir.' 'We'll cut the fenders off like the Indians do in Oklahoma. She's over-fendered right now. She's got too much of everything except engine. Jackson, that's a real engine she's got.' 'It certainly is, sir. It's a great pleasure to drive that big engine on the good roads. That's why I don't want anything to happen to her.' 'That's very good of you, Jackson. Now just quit suffering.' 'I'm not suffering, sir.' 'Good,' said the Colonel. He was not, either, because just then he saw, beyond the line of close-bunched brown trees ahead, a sail moving along. It was a big red sail, raked sharply down from the peak, and it moved slowly behind the trees. Why should it always move your heart to see a sail moving along through the country, the Colonel thought. Why does it move my heart to see the great, slow, pale oxen? It must be the gait as well as the look of them and the size and the colour. But a good fine big mule, or a string of pack mules in good condition, moves me, too. So does a coyote every time I ever see one, and a wolf, gaited like no other animal, grey and sure of himself, carrying that heavy head and with the hostile eyes. 'Ever see any wolves out around Rawlins, Jackson?' 'No, sir. Wolves were gone before my time; they poisoned them out. Plenty coyotes, though.' 'Do you like coyotes?' 'I like to hear them nights.' 'So do I. Better than anything, except seeing a ship sailing along through the country.' 'There's a boat doing that over there, sir.' 'On the Sile canal,' the Colonel told him. 'She's a sailing barge going to Venice. This wind is off the mountains now and she makes it along pretty good. It's liable to turn really cold to-night if this wind holds and it ought to bring in plenty ducks. Turn to your left here and we'll run along the canal. There's a good road.' 'They didn't have much duck shooting where I came from. But there was plenty of it in Nebraska along the Platte.' 'Do you want to shoot where we're going?' 'I don't believe so, sir. I'm not much of a shot, and I'd rather stay in that sack. It's a Sunday morning, you know.' 'I know,' the Colonel said. 'You can stay in the sack until noon if you want.' 'I brought my repellent. I ought to sleep O.K.' 'I'm not sure you'll need it,' the Colonel said. 'Did you bring any K-rations or Ten in One? They're liable to eat Italian food, you know.' 'I brought a few cans to help out and a little stuff to give away.' 'That's good,' the Colonel said. He was looking ahead now to see where the canal road joined the main highway again. There he knew that he would see it on a clear day such as this was. Across the marshes, brown as those at the mouths of the Mississippi around Pilot Town are in winter, and with their reeds bent by the heavy north wind, he saw the squared tower of the church at Torcello and the high campanile of Burano beyond it. The sea was a slate blue and he could see the sails of twelve sailing barges running with the wind for Venice. I'll have to wait until we cross the Dese River above Noghera to see it perfectly, he thought. It is strange to remember how we fought back there along the canal that winter to defend it and we never saw it. Then one time, I was back as far as Noghera and it was clear and cold like to-day, and I saw it across the water. But I never got into it. It is my city, though, because I fought for it when I was a boy, and now that I am half a hundred years old, they know I fought for it and am a part owner and they treat me well. Do you think that's why they treat you well, he asked himself. Maybe, he thought. Maybe they treat me well because I'm a chicken colonel on the winning side. I don't believe it, though. I hope not, anyway. It is not France, he thought. There you fight your way into a city that you love and are very careful about breaking anything and then, if you have good sense, you are careful not to go back because you will meet some military characters who will resent your having fought your way in. Vive la France et les pommes de terre frites. LibertÃ©, VenalitÃ©, et StupiditÃ©. The great clarte of the French military thinking. They haven't had a military thinker since du Picq. He was a poor bloody Colonel, too. Mangin, Maginot and Gamelin. Take your choice, Gentlemen. Three schools of thought. One; I hit them on the nose. Two; I hide behind this thing which does not cover my left flank. Three; I hide my head in the sand like an ostrich, confident in the greatness of France as a military power and then take off. Take off is putting it very cleanly and pleasantly. Sure, he thought, whenever you over-simplify you become unjust. Remember all the fine ones in the Resistance, remember Foch both fought and organized and remember how fine the people were. Remember your good friends and remember your deads. Remember plenty things and your best friends again and the finest people that you know. Don't be a bitter nor a stupid. And what has that to do with soldiering as a trade? Cut it out, he told himself. You're on a trip to have fun. 'Jackson,' he said, 'are you happy?' 'Yes, sir.' 'Good. Shortly, we are coming to a view that I want you to see. You only have to take one look at it. The entire operation will be practically painless.' I wonder what he's riding me for now, the driver thought. Just because he was a B.G. once he knows everything. If he was any good as a B.G. why didn't he hold it? He's been beat up so much he's slug-nutty. 'There's the view, Jackson,' the Colonel said. 'Stop her by the side of the road and we'll take a look.' The Colonel and the driver walked over to the Venice side of the road and looked across the lagoon that was whipped by the strong, cold wind from the mountains that sharpened all the outlines of buildings so that they were geometrically clear. 'That's Torcello directly opposite us,' the Colonel pointed. 'That where the people lived that were driven off the mainland by the Visigoths. They built that church you see there with the square tower. There were thirty thousand people lived there once and they built that church to honour their Lord and to worship him. Then, after they built it, the mouth of the Sile River silted up or a big flood changed it, and all that land we came through just now got flooded and started to breed mosquitoes and malaria hit them. They all started to die, so the elders got together and decided they should pull out to a healthy place that would be defensible with boats, and where the Visigoths and the Lombards and the other bandits couldn't get at them, because these bandits had no sea-power. The Torcello boys were all great boatmen. So they took the stones of all their houses in barges, like that one we just saw, and they built Venice.' He stopped. 'Am I boring you, Jackson?' 'No, sir. I had no idea who pioneered Venice.' 'It was the boys from Torcello. They were very tough and they had very good taste in building. They came from a little place up the coast called Caorle. But they drew on all the people from the towns and the farms behind when the Visigoths overran them. It was a Torcello boy who was running arms into Alexandria, who located the body of St. Mark and smuggled it out under a load of fresh pork so the infidel customs guards wouldn't check him. This boy brought the remains of St. Mark to Venice, and he's their patron saint and they have a cathedral there to him. But by that time, they were trading so far to the east that the architecture is pretty Byzantine for my taste. They never built any better than at the start there in Torcello. That's Torcello there.' It was, indeed. 'St Mark's square is where the pigeons are and where they have that big cathedral that looks sort of like a moving picture palace, isn't it?' 'Right, Jackson. You're on the ball. If that's the way you look at it. Now you look beyond Torcello you will see the lovely campanile on Burano that has damn near as much list on it as the leaning tower of Pisa. That Burano is a very over-populated little island where the women make wonderful lace, and the men make bambinis and work day-times in the glass factories in that next island you see on beyond with the other campanile, which is Murano. They make wonderful glass day-times for the rich of all the world, and then they come home on the little vaporetto and make bambinis. Not everyone passes every night with his wife though. They hunt ducks nights too, with big punt guns, out along the edge of the marshes on this lagoon you're looking across now. All night long on a moonlight night you hear the shots.' He paused. 'Now when you look past Murano you see Venice. That's my town. There's plenty more I could show you, but I think we probably ought to roll now. But take one good look at it. This is where you can see how it all happened. But nobody ever looks at it from here.' 'It's a beautiful view. Thank you, sir.' 'O.K.,' the Colonel said. 'Let's roll.' Chapter V But he continued to look and it was all as wonderful to him and it moved him as it had when he was eighteen years old and had seen it first, understanding nothing of it and only knowing that it was beautiful. The winter had come very cold that year and all the mountains were white beyond the plain. It was necessary for the Austrians to try to break through at the angle where the Sile River and the old bed of the Piave were the only lines of defence. If you had the old bed of the Piave then you had the Sile to fall back on if the first line did not hold. Beyond the Sile there was nothing but bare-assed plain and a good road network into the Veneto plain and the plains of Lombardy, and the Austrians attacked again and again and again late through the winter, to try to get on to this fine road that they were rolling on now which led straight to Venice. That winter the Colonel, who was a lieutenant then, and in a foreign army, which had always made him slightly suspect afterwards in his own army, and had done his career no good, had a sore throat all winter. This sore throat was from being in the water so much. You could not get dry and it was better to get wet quickly and stay wet. The Austrian attacks were ill co-ordinated, but they were constant and exasperated and you first had the heavy bombardment which was supposed to put you out of business, and then, when it lifted, you checked your positions and counted the people. But you had no time to care for wounded, since you knew that the attack was coming immediately, and then you killed the men who came wading across the marshes, holding their rifles above the water and coming as slow as men wade, waist deep. If they did not lift the shelling when it started, the Colonel, then a lieutenant, often thought, I do not know what we would be able to do. But they always lifted it and moved it back ahead of the attack. If we had lost the old Piave and were on the Sile they would move it back to the second and third lines; although such lines were quite untenable, and they should have brought all their guns up very close and whammed it in all the time they attacked and until they breached us. But thank God, some high fool always controls it, the Colonel thought, and they did it piecemeal. All that winter, with a bad sore throat, he had killed men who came, wearing the stick bombs hooked up on a harness under their shoulders with the heavy, calf-hide packs and the bucket helmets. They were the enemy. But he never hated them; nor could have any feeling about them. He commanded with an old sock around his throat, which had been dipped in turpentine, and they broke down the attacks with rifle fire and with the machine guns which still existed, or were usable, after the bombardment. He taught his people to shoot, really, which is a rare ability in continental troops, and to be able to look at the enemy when they came, and, because there was always a dead moment when the shooting was free, they became very good at it. But you always had to count and count fast after the bombardment to know how many shooters you would have. He was hit three times that winter, but they were all gift wounds; small wounds in the flesh of the body without breaking bone, and he had become quite confident of his personal immortality since he knew he should have been killed in the heavy artillery bombardment that always preceded the attacks. Finally, he did get hit properly and for good. No one of his other wounds had ever done to him what the first big one did. I suppose it is just the loss of the immortality, he thought. Well, in a way, that is quite a lot to lose. This country meant very much to him, more than he could, or would ever tell anyone and now he sat in the car happy that in another half hour they would be in Venice. He took two mannitol hexanitrate tablets; since he had always been able to spit since 1918, he could take them dry, and asked: 'How are you doing, Jackson?' 'Fine, sir.' 'Take the left outside road when we hit the fork for Mestre and we'll be able to see the boats along the canal and miss that main traffic.' 'Yes, sir,' the driver said. 'Will you check me on the fork?' 'Of course,' the Colonel said. They were coming up on Mestre fast, and already it was like going to New York the first time you were ever there in the old days when it was shining, white and beautiful. I stole that, he thought. But that was before the smoke. We are coming into my town, he thought. Christ, what a lovely town. They made the left turn and came along the canal where the fishing boats tied up, and the Colonel looked at them and his heart was happy because of the brown nets and the wicker fish traps and the clean, beautiful lines of the boats. It's not that they are picturesque. The hell with picturesque. They are just damned beautiful. They passed the long line of boats in the slow canal that carried water from the Brenta, and he thought about the long stretch of the Brenta where the great villas were, with their lawns and their gardens and the plane trees and the cypresses. I'd like to be buried out there, he thought. I know the place very well. I don't believe you could fix it, though. I don't know. I know some people that might let me be buried on their place. I'll ask Alberto. He might think it was morbid, though. For a long time he had been thinking about all the fine places he would like to be buried and what parts of the earth he would like to be a part of. The stinking, putrefying part doesn't last very long, really, he thought, and anyway you are just a sort of mulch, and even the bones will be some use finally. I'd like to be buried way out at the edge of the grounds, but in sight of the old graceful house and the tall, great trees. I don't think it would be much of a nuisance to them. I could be a part of the ground where the children play in the evenings, and in the mornings, maybe, they would still be training jumping horses and their hoofs would make the thudding on the turf, and trout would rise in the pool when there was a hatch of fly. They were up on the causeway from Mestre to Venice now with the ugly Breda works that might have been Hammond, Indiana. 'What do they make there, sir?' Jackson asked. 'The company makes locomotives in Milan,' the Colonel said. 'Here they make a little of everything in the metallurgic line.' It was a miserable view of Venice now and he always disliked this causeway except that you made such good time and you could see the buoys and the channels. 'This town makes a living on its own,' he said to Jackson. 'She used to be the queen of the seas and the people are very tough and they give less of a good God-damn about things than almost anybody you'll ever meet. It's a tougher town than Cheyenne when you really know it, and everybody is very polite.' 'I wouldn't say Cheyenne was a tough town, sir.' 'Well, it's a tougher town than Casper.' 'Do you think that's a tough town, sir?' 'It's an oil town. It's a nice town.' 'But I don't think it's tough, sir. Or ever was.' 'O.K., Jackson. Maybe we move in different circles. Or maybe we have a differing definition for the word. But this town of Venice, with everybody being polite and having good manners, is as tough as Cooke City, Montana, on the day they have the Old Timers' Fish Fry.' 'My idea of a tough town is Memphis.' 'Not like Chicago, Jackson. Memphis is only tough if you are a Negro. Chicago is tough North, South, there isn't any East and West. But nobody has any manners. But in this country, if you ever want to know a really tough town where they eat wonderfully, too, go to Bologna.' 'I never was there.' 'Well, there's the Fiat garage where we leave the car,' the Colonel said. 'You can leave the key at the office. They don't steal. I'll go in the bar while you park upstairs. They have people that will bring the bags.' 'Is it O.K. to leave your gun and shooting gear in the trunk, sir?' 'Sure. They don't steal here. I told you that once.' 'I wanted to take the necessary precautions, sir, on your valuable property.' 'You're so damned noble that sometimes you stink,' the Colonel said. 'Get the wax out of your ears and hear what I say the first time.' 'I heard you, sir,' Jackson said. The Colonel looked at him contemplatively and with the old deadliness. He sure is a mean son of a bitch, Jackson thought, and he can be so God-damn nice. 'Get my and your bag out and park her up there and check your oil, your water and your tyres,' the Colonel said, and walked across the oil and rubber stained cement of the entry of the bar. Chapter VI In the bar, sitting at the first table as he came in, there was a post-war rich from Milan, fat and hard as only Milanese can be, sitting with his expensive looking and extremely desirable mistress. They were drinking negronis, a combination of two sweet vermouths and seltzer water, and the Colonel wondered how much taxes the man had escaped to buy that sleek girl in her long mink coat and the convertible he had seen the chauffeur take up the long, winding ramp to lock away. The pair stared at him with the bad manners of their kind and he saluted, lightly and said to them in Italian, 'I am sorry that I am in uniform. But it is a uniform. Not a costume.' Then he turned his back on them, without waiting to see the effect of his remark, and walked to the bar. From the bar you could watch your luggage, just as well as the two pescecani were watching theirs. He is probably a Commendatore, he thought. She is a beautiful, hard piece of work. She is damned beautiful, actually. I wonder what it would have been like if I had ever had the money to buy me that kind and put them into the mink? I'll settle for what I have, he thought, and they can go and hang themselves. The bar-tender shook hands with him. This bar-tender was an Anarchist but he did not mind the Colonel being a Colonel at all. He was delighted by it and proud and loving about it as though the Anarchists had a Colonel, too, and in some ways, in the several months that they had known each other, he seemed to feel that he had invented, or at least erected, the Colonel as you might be happy about participating in the erection of a campanile, or even the old church at Torcello. The bar-tender had heard the conversation, or, rather, the flat statement at the table and he was very happy. He had already sent down, via the dumb-waiter, for a Gordon's gin and Campari and he said, 'It is coming up in that hand-pulled device. How does everything go at Trieste?' 'About as you would imagine.' 'I couldn't even imagine.' 'Then don't strain,' the Colonel said, 'and you will never get piles.' 'I wouldn't mind it if I was a Colonel.' 'I never mind it.' 'You'd be overrun like a dose of salts,' the waiter said. 'Don't tell the Honorable Pacciardi,' the Colonel said. He and the bar-tender had a joke about this because the Honourable Pacciardi was Minister of Defence in the Italian Republic. He was the same age as the Colonel and had fought very well in the first world war, and had also fought in Spain as a battalion commander where the Colonel had known him when he, himself, was an observer. The seriousness with which the Honourable Pacciardi took the post of Minister of Defence of an indefensible country was a bond between the Colonel and the bar-tender. The two of them were quite practical men and the vision of the Honourable Pacciardi defending the Italian Republic stimulated their minds. 'It's sort of funny up there,' the Colonel said, 'and I don't mind it.' 'We must mechanize the Honourable Pacciardi,' the bar-tender said. 'And supply him with the atomic bomb.' 'I've got three of them in the back of the car,' the Colonel said. 'The new model, complete with handles. But we can't leave him unarmed. We must supply him with botulism and anthrax.' 'We cannot fail the Honourable Pacciardi,' the bar-tender said. 'Better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.' 'Better to die on our feet than to live on our knees,' the Colonel said. 'Though you better get on your belly damn fast if you want to stay alive in plenty places.' 'Colonel, do not say anything subversive.' 'We will strangle them with our bare hands,' the Colonel said. 'A million men will spring to arms overnight.' 'Whose arms?' the bar-tender asked. 'All that will be attended to,' the Colonel said. 'It's only a phase in the Big Picture.' Just then the driver came in the door. The Colonel saw that while they had been joking, he had not watched the door and he was annoyed, always, with any lapse of vigilance or of security. 'What the hell's been keeping you, Jackson? Have a drink.' 'No, thank you, sir.' You prissy jerk, the Colonel thought. But I better stop riding him; he corrected. 'We'll be going in a minute,' the Colonel said. 'I've been trying to learn Italian from my friend here.' He turned to look at the Milan profiteers; but they were gone. I'm getting awfully slow, he thought. Somebody will take me any day now. Maybe even the Honourable Pacciardi, he thought. 'How much do I owe you?' he asked the bar-tender shortly. The bar-tender told him and looked at him with his wise Italian eyes, not merry now, although the lines of merriment were clearly cut where they radiated from the corners of each eye. I hope there is nothing wrong with him, the bar-tender thought. I hope to God, or anything else, there's nothing really bad. 'Good-bye, my Colonel,' he said. 'Ciao,' the Colonel said. 'Jackson, we are going down the long ramp and due north from the exit to where the small launches are moored. The varnished ones. There is a porter with the two bags. It is necessary to let them carry them since they have a concession.' 'Yes, sir,' said Jackson. The two of them went out the door and no one looked back at anyone. At the imbarcadero, the Colonel tipped the man who had carried their two bags and then looked around for a boatman he knew. He did not recognize the man in the launch that was first on call, but the boatman said, 'Good day, my Colonel. I'm the first.' 'How much is it to the Gritti?' 'You know as well as I, my Colonel. We do not bargain. We have a fixed tariff.' 'What's the tariff?' 'Three thousand five hundred.' 'We could go on the vaporetto for sixty.' 'And nothing prevents you going,' the boatman, who was an elderly man with a red but un-choleric face, said. 'They won't take you to the Gritti but they will stop at the imbarcadero past Harry's, and you can telephone for someone from the Gritti to get your bags.' And what would I buy with the God-damn three thousand five hundred lire; and this is a good old man. 'Do you want me to send that man there?' he pointed to a destroyed old man who did odd jobs and ran errands around the docks, always ready with the un-needed aid to the elbow of the ascending or descending passenger, always ready to help when no help was needed, his old felt hat held out as he bowed after the unneeded act. 'He'll take you to the vaporetto. There's one in twenty minutes.' 'The hell with it,' the Colonel said. 'Take us to the Gritti.' 'Con piacere,' the boatman said. The Colonel and Jackson lowered themselves into the launch which looked like a speed boat. It was radiantly varnished and lovingly kept and was powered with a marine conversion of a tiny Fiat engine that had served its allotted time in the car of a provincial doctor and had been purchased out of one of the graveyards of automobiles; those mechanical elephant cemeteries that are the one certain thing you may find in our world near any populated centre; and been re-conditioned and re-converted to start this new life on the canals of this city. 'How is the motor doing?' the Colonel asked. He could hear her sounding like a stricken tank or T.D., except the noises were in miniature from the lack of power. 'So-so,' the boatman said. He moved his free hand in a parallel motion. 'You ought to get the smallest model Universal puts out. That's the best and lightest small marine engine I know.' 'Yes,' the boatman said. 'There are quite a few things I should get.' 'Maybe you'll have a good year.' 'It's always possible. Lots of pescecani come down from Milano to gamble at the Lido. But nobody would ride twice in this thing on purpose. As a boat, it is fine, too. It is a well built, pleasant boat. Not beautiful as a gondola is, of course. But it needs an engine.' 'I might get you a jeep engine. One that was condemned and you could work it over.' 'Don't talk about such things,' the boatman said. 'Things like that don't happen. I don't want to think about it.' 'You can think about it,' the Colonel said. 'I'm talking true.' 'You mean it.' 'Sure. I don't guarantee anything. I'll see what I can do. How many children have you got?' 'Six. Two male and four female.' 'Hell, you mustn't have believed in the Regime. Only six.' 'I didn't believe in the Regime.' 'You don't have to give me that stuff,' the Colonel said. 'It would have been quite natural for you to have believed in it. Do you think I hold that against a man after we've won?' They were through the dull part of the canal that runs from Piazzale Roma to Ca'Foscari, though none of it is dull, the Colonel thought. It doesn't all have to be palaces nor churches. Certainly that isn't dull. He looked to the right, the starboard, he thought. I'm on the water. It was a long low pleasant building and there was a trattoria next to it. I ought to live here. On retirement pay I could make it all right. No Gritti Palace. A room in a house like that and the tides and the boats going by. I could read in the mornings and walk around town before lunch and go every day to see the Tintorettos at the Accademia and to the Sculoa San Rocco and eat in good cheap joints behind the market or, maybe, the woman that ran the house would cook in the evenings. I think it would be better to have lunch out and get some exercise walking. It's a good town to walk in. I guess the best, probably. I never walked in it that it wasn't fun. I could learn it really well, he thought, and then I'd have that. It's a strange, tricky town and to walk from any part to any other given part of it is better than working crossword puzzles. It's one of the few things to our credit that we never smacked it, and to their credit that they respected it. Christ, I love it, he said, and I'm so happy I helped defend it when I was a punk kid, and with an insufficient command of the language and I never even saw her until that clear day in the winter when I went back to have that small wound dressed, and saw her rising from the sea. Merde, he thought, we did very well that winter up at the junction. I wish I could fight it again, he thought. Knowing what I know now and having what we have now. But they'd have it too and the essential problem is just the same, except who holds the air. And all this time he had been watching the bow of the beat-up beautifully varnished, delicately brass-striped boat, with the brass all beautifully polished, cut the brown water and seen the small traffic problems. They went under the white bridge and under the unfinished wood bridge. Then they left the red bridge on the right and passed under the first high-flying white bridge. Then there was the black iron fret-work bridge on the canal leading into the Rio Nuovo and they passed the two stakes chained together but not touching: like us the Colonel thought. He watched the tide pull at them and he saw how the chains had worn the wood since he first had seen them. That's us, he thought. That's our monument. And how many monuments are there to us in the canals of this town? Then they still went slowly until the great lantern that was on the right of the entrance to the Grand Canal where the engine commenced its metallic agony that produced a slight increase in speed. Now they came down and under the Accademia between the pilings where they passed, at touching distance, a heavily loaded black, diesel boat full of cut timber, cut to chunks, to burn for firewood in the damp houses of the Sea City. 'That's beech, isn't it?' the Colonel asked the boatman. 'Beech and another wood that is cheaper that I do not recall, at this moment, the name of.' 'Beech is, to an open fire, as anthracite coal is to a stove. Where do they cut that beech?' 'I'm not a man of the mountains. But I think it comes from up beyond Bassano on the other side of the Grappa. I went there to the Grappa to see where my brother was buried. It was an excursion that they made from Bassano, and we went to the big ossario. But we returned by Feltre. I could see it was a fine timber country on the other side as you came down the mountains into the valley. We came down that military road, and they were hauling lots of wood.' 'In what year was your brother killed on Grappa?' 'In nineteen-eighteen. He was a patriot and inflamed by hearing d'Annunzio talk, and he volunteered before his class was called. We never knew him very well because he went so quickly.' 'How many were you in the family?' 'We were six. We lost two beyond the Isonzo, one on the Bainsizza and one on the Carso. Then we lost this brother I speak of on the Grappa and I remained.' 'I'll get you the God-damned jeep complete with handles,' the Colonel said. 'Now let's not be morbid and look for all the places where my friends live.' They were moving up the Grand Canal now and it was easy to see where your friends lived. 'That's the house of the Contessa Dandolo,' the Colonel said. He did not say, but thought, she is over eighty, and she is as gay as a girl and does not have any fear of dying. She dies her hair red and it looks very well. She is a good companion and an admirable woman. Her palazzo was pleasant looking, set well back from the Canal with a garden in front and a landing place of its own where many gondolas had come, in their various times, bringing hearty, cheerful, sad and disillusioned people. But most of them had been cheerful because they were going to see the Contessa Dandolo. Now, beating up the Canal, against the cold wind off the mountains, and with the houses as clear and sharp as on a winter day, which, of course, it was, they saw the old magic of the city and its beauty. But it was conditioned, for the Colonel, by his knowing many of the people who lived in the palazzos; or if no one lived there now, knowing to what use the different places had been put. There's Alvarito's mother's house, he thought, and did not say. She never lives there much and stays out at the country house near Treviso where they have trees. She's tired of there not being trees in Venice. She lost a fine man and nothing really interests her now except efficiency. But the family at one time lent the house to George Gordon, Lord Byron, and nobody sleeps now in Byron's bed nor in the other bed, two flights below, where he used to sleep with the gondolier's wife. They are not sacred, nor relics. They are just extra beds that were not used afterwards for various reasons, or possibly to respect Lord Byron who was well loved in this town, in spite of all the errors he committed. You have to be a tough boy in this town to be loved, the Colonel thought. They never cared anything for Robert Browning, nor Mrs. Robert Browning, nor for their dog. They weren't Venetians no matter how well he wrote of it. And what is a tough boy, he asked himself. You use it so loosely you should be able to define it. I suppose it is a man who will make his play and then backs it up. Or just a man who backs his play. And I'm not thinking of the theatre, he thought. Lovely as the theatre can be. And yet, he thought, seeing now the little villa, close up against the water, ugly as a building you would see on the boat train from Havre or Cherbourg, coming into the banlieue before Paris as you came into town. It was overrun with badly administered trees, and not a place that you would live in if you could help it. There he lived. They loved him for his talent, and because he was bad, and he was brave. A Jewish boy with nothing, he stormed the country with his talent, and his rhetoric. He was a more miserable character than any that I know and as mean. But the man I think of to compare him with never put the chips on the line and went to war, the Colonel thought, and Gabriele d'Annunzio (I always wondered what his real name was, he thought, because nobody is named d'Annunzio in a practical country and perhaps he was not Jewish and what difference did it make if he was or was not) had moved through the different arms of the service as he had moved into and out of the arms of different women. All the arms were pleasant that d'Annunzio served with and the mission was fast and easily over, except the Infantry. He remembered how d'Annunzio had lost an eye in a crash, flying as an observer, over Trieste or Pola, and how, afterwards, he had always worn a patch over it and people who did not know, for, then, no one really knew, thought it had been shot out at the Veliki or San Michele or some other bad place beyond the Carso where everyone died, or was incapacitated, that you knew. But d'Annunzio, truly, was only making heroic gestures with the other things. An Infantryman knows a strange trade, he thought; perhaps the strangest. He, Gabriele, flew, but he was not a flier. He was in the Infantry but he was not an Infantryman and it was always the same appearances. And the Colonel remembered one time when he had stood, commanding a platoon of assault troops, while it was raining in one of the interminable winters, when the rain fell always; or at least, always when there were parades or speeches to the troops, and d'Annunzio, with his lost eye, covered by the patch, and his white face, as white as the belly of a sole, new turned over in the market, the brown side not showing, and looking thirty hours dead, was shouting. 'Morire non a basta,' and the Colonel, then a lieutenant, had thought, 'What the muck more do they want of us?' But he had followed the discourse and, at the end, when the Lieutenant-Colonel d'Annunzio, writer and national hero, certified and true if you must have heroes, and the Colonel did not believe in heroes, asked for a moment of silence for our glorious dead, he had stood stiffly to attention. But his platoon, who had not followed the speech, there being no loud speakers then, and they being slightly out of hearing of the orator, responded, as one man, at the pause for the moment of silence for our glorious dead, with a solid and ringing 'Evviva d'Annunzio'. They had been addressed before by d'Annunzio after victories, and before defeats, and they knew what they should shout if there was any pause by an orator. The Colonel, being then a lieutenant, and loving his platoon, had joined with them and uttered, with the tone of command, 'Evviva d'Annunzio', thus absolving all those who had not listened to the discourse, speech, or harangue and attempting, in the small way a lieutenant can attempt anything, except to hold an indefensible position; or intelligently direct his own part in an attack; to share their guilt. But now he was passing the house where the poor beat-up old boy had lived with his great, sad and never properly loved actress and he thought of her wonderful hands and her so transformable face, that was not beautiful, but that gave you all love, glory and delight and sadness; and of the way the curve of her forearm could break your heart, and he thought, Christ they are dead and I do not know where either one is buried even. But I certainly hope they had fun in that house. 'Jackson,' he said, 'that small villa on the left belonged to Gabriele d'Annunzio, who was a great writer.' 'Yes, sir,' said Jackson, 'I'm glad to know about him. I never heard of him.' 'I'll check you out on what he wrote if you ever want to read him,' the Colonel said. 'There are some fair English translations.' 'Thank you, sir,' said Jackson. 'I'd like to read him any time I have time. He has a nice practical looking place. What did you say the name was?' 'D'Annunzio,' the Colonel said. 'Writer.' He added to himself, not wishing to confuse Jackson, nor be difficult, as he had been with the man several times that day, writer, poet, national hero, phraser of the dialectic of Fascism, macabre egotist, aviator, commander, or rider, in the first of the fast torpedo attack boats, Lieutenant-Colonel of Infantry without knowing how to command a company, nor a platoon properly, the great, lovely writer of Notturno whom we respect, and jerk. Up ahead now there was a crossing place of gondolas at the Santa Maria del Giglio and, beyond, was the wooden dock of the Gritti. 'That's the hotel where we are stopping at, Jackson.' The Colonel indicated the three-storey, rose-coloured, small, pleasant palace abutting on the Canal. It had been a dependence of the Grand Hotelâ€”but now it was its own hotel and a very good one. It was probably the best hotel, if you did not wish to be fawned on, or fussed over, or over-flunkied, in a city of great hotels and the Colonel loved it. 'It looks O.K. to me, sir,' Jackson said. 'It is O.K.,' the Colonel said. The motor boat came gallantly up beside the piling of the dock. Every move she makes, the Colonel thought, is a triumph of the gallantry of the ageing machine. We do not have war horses now like old Traveller, or Marbot's Lysette who fought, personally, at Eylau. We have the gallantry of worn through-rods that refuse to break; the cylinder head that does not blow though it has every right to and the rest of it. 'We're at the dock, sir,' Jackson said. 'Where the hell else would we be, man. Jump out while I settle with this sportsman.' He turned to the boatman and said, 'That was thirty-five hundred, wasn't it?' 'Yes, my Colonel.' 'I'll not forget about the over-age jeep engine. Take this and buy your horse some oats.' The porter, who was taking the bags from Jackson, heard this and laughed. 'No veterinarian will ever fix his horse.' 'She still runs,' the boatman said. 'But she doesn't win any races,' the porter said. 'How are you, my Colonel?' 'I couldn't be better,' the Colonel said. 'How are all the members of the Order?' 'All members are well.' 'Good,' said the Colonel. 'I will go in and see the Grand Master.' 'He is waiting for you, my Colonel.' 'Let us not keep him waiting, Jackson,' the Colonel said. 'You may proceed to the lobby with this gentleman and tell them to sign me in. See the sergeant gets a room,' he said to the porter. 'We're here for the night only.' 'The Baron Alvarito was here looking for you.' 'I'll find him at Harry's.' 'Good, my Colonel.' 'Where is the Grand Master?' 'I'll find him for you.' 'Tell him I'll be in the bar.' Chapter VII The bar was just across from the lobby of the Gritti, although lobby the Colonel thought, was not the accurate term to describe that gracious entrance. Didn't Giotto describe a circle, he thought? No, that was in maths. What he remembered and loved best as an anecdote about that painter was: 'It was easy,' said Giotto as he drew the perfect circle. Who the hell had said that and where? 'Good evening, Privy Councillor,' he said to the bar-man, who was not a full paid-up member of the order but whom he did not wish to offend. 'What can I do for you?' 'Drink, my Colonel.' The Colonel looked out of the windows and the door of the bar on to the waters of the Grand Canal. He could see the big black hitching post for the gondolas and the later afternoon winter light on the wind-swept water. Across the Canal was the old Palace and a wood barge, black and broad, was coming up the Canal, her bluff bows pushing up a wave even though she had the wind behind her. 'Make it a very dry Martini,' the Colonel said. 'A double.' Just then the Grand Master came into the room. He was wearing his formal attire as a head waiter. He was truly handsome as a man should be, from the inside out, so that his smile starts from his heart, or whatever is the centre of the body, and comes frankly and beautifully to the surface, which is the face. He had a fine face with the long, straight nose of his part of the Veneto; the kind, gay, truthful eyes and the honourable white hair of his age, which was two years older than that of the Colonel. He advanced smiling, lovingly and yet conspiratorially, since they both shared many secrets and he extended his hand, which was a big, long, strong, spatular-fingered hand; well kept as was becoming, as well as necessary, to his position and the Colonel extended his own hand, which had been shot through twice and was slightly misshapen. Thus contact was made between two old inhabitants of the Veneto, both men and brothers in their membership in the human race, the only club that either one paid dues to and brothers, too, in their love of an old country, much fought over and always triumphant in defeat, which they had both defended in their youth. Their handshake was only long enough to feel, firmly, the contact and the pleasure of meeting and then the Maitre d'Hotel said, 'My Colonel.' The Colonel said, 'Gran Maestro.' Then the Colonel asked the Gran Maestro to accompany him in a drink, but the Maitre d'Hotel said that he was working. It was impossible as well as forbidden. 'â€”â€” forbidden,' said the Colonel. 'Of course,' the Gran Maestro said. 'But everyone must comply with his duty and here the rules are reasonable and we all should comply with them; me especially, as a matter of precept.' 'Not for nothing are you the Gran Maestro,' the Colonel said. 'Give me a small Carpano punto e mezzo,' the Gran Maestro said to the bar-tender, who was still outside of the Order for some small, not defined, unstated reason. 'To drink to the ordine.' Thus, violating orders and the principle of precept and example in command, the Colonel and the Gran Maestro downed a quick one. They did not hurry nor did the Gran Maestro worry. They simply made it fast. 'Now, let us discuss the affairs of the Order,' the Colonel said. 'Are we in the secret chamber?' 'We are,' said the Gran Maestro. 'Or I declare it to be such.' 'Continue,' said the Colonel. The Order, which was a purely fictitious organization, had been founded in a series of conversations between the Gran Maestro and the Colonel. Its name was El Ordine Militar, Nobile y Espirituoso de los Caballeros de Brusadelli. The Colonel and the head waiter both spoke Spanish and since that is the best language for founding orders, they had used it in the naming of this one, which was named after a particularly notorious multi-millionaire non-taxpaying profiteer of Milan, who had, in the course of a dispute over property, accused his young wife, publicly and legally through due process of law, of having deprived him of his judgment through her extraordinary sexual demands. 'Gran Maestro,' the Colonel said. 'Have you heard from our Leader, The Reverend One?' 'Not a word. He is silent these days.' 'He must be thinking.' 'He must.' 'Perhaps he is meditating on new and more distinguished shameful acts.' 'Perhaps. He has not given me any word.' 'But we can have confidence in him.' 'Until he dies,' the Gran Maestro said. 'After that he can roast in hell and we will revere his memory.' 'Giorgio,' the Colonel said. 'Give the Gran Maestro another short Carpano.' 'If it is your order,' the Gran Maestro said, 'I can only obey.' They touched glasses. 'Jackson,' the Colonel called. 'You're on the town. You can sign here for chow. I don't want to see you until eleven hundred to-morrow in the lobby, unless you get into trouble. Do you have money?' 'Yes, sir,' Jackson said and thought, the old son of a bitch really is as crazy as they say. But he might have called me instead of shouting. 'I don't want to see you,' the Colonel said. Jackson had entered the room and stood before him at a semblance of attention. 'I'm tired of seeing you, because you worry and you don't have fun. For Christ sake have yourself some fun.' 'Yes, sir.' 'You understand what I said?' 'Yes, sir.' 'Repeat it.' 'Ronald Jackson, T5 Serial Number 100678, will present himself in the lobby of this Gritti Hotel at 11.00 to-morrow morning, I don't know the date, sir, and will absent himself from the Colonel's sight and will have some fun. Or,' he added, 'will make every reasonable attempt to attain that objective.' 'I'm sorry, Jackson,' the Colonel said. 'I'm a â€”â€”.' 'I beg to differ with the Colonel,' Jackson said. 'Thank you, Jackson,' the Colonel told him. 'Maybe I'm not. I hope you are correct. Now muck off. You've got a room here, or you should have and you can sign for chow. Now try and have some fun.' 'Yes, sir,' said Jackson. When he was gone, the Gran Maestro said to the Colonel, 'What is the boy? One of those sad Americans?' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'And by Jesus Christ we've got a lot of them. Sad, self-righteous, over-fed and undertrained. If they are under-trained, it is my fault. But we've got some good ones, too.' 'Do you think they would have done Grappa, Pasubio and the Basso Piave as we did?' 'The good ones, yes. Maybe better. But you know, in our army, they don't even shoot for self-inflicted wounds.' 'Jesus,' said the Gran Maestro. He and the Colonel both remembered the men who decided that they did not wish to die, not thinking that he who dies on Thursday does not have to die on Friday and how one soldier would wrap another's puttee-ed leg in a sandbag so there would be no powder burns and loose off at his friend from as far a distance as he figured he could hit the calf of the leg without hitting bone and then fire twice over the parapet to alibi the shot. They had this knowledge shared between them and it was for this reason and for a true, good hatred of all those who profited by war that they had founded the Order. They knew, the two of them, who loved and respected each other, how poor boys who did not want to die, would share the contents of a match-box to produce the infection that would keep them from the next murderous frontal attack. They knew about the other boys who put the big ten-centime pieces under their arm-pits to produce jaundice. And they knew, too, about the richer boys who, in different cities, had paraffin injected under their knee-caps so they would not have to go to the war. They knew how garlic could be used to produce certain effects which could absent a man from an attack and they knew all, or nearly all, of the other tricks; for one had been a sergeant and the other a lieutenant of infantry and they had fought on the three key points, Pasubio, Grappa and the Piave, where it all made sense. They had fought, too, in the earlier stupid butchery on the Isonzo and the Carso. But they were both ashamed of those who had ordered that and they never thought about it except as a shameful, stupid thing to be forgotten and the Colonel remembered it technically as something to learn from. So, now, they had founded the Order of Brusadelli; noble, military and religious, and there were only five members. 'What is the news of the Order?' the Colonel asked the Gran Maestro. 'We have ascended the cook at the Magnificent to the rank of Commendatore. He comported himself as a man three times on his fiftieth birthday. I accepted his statement without corroboration. He never lied ever.' 'No. He never lied. But it is a topic on which you must be chary in your credibility.' 'I believed him. He looked ruined.' 'I can remember him when he was a tough kid and we called him the cherry buster.' 'Anch' io.' 'Have you any concrete plans for the Order during the winter?' 'No, Supreme Commander.' 'Do you think we should give a homage to the Honourable Pacciardi?' 'As you wish.' 'Let's defer it,' the Colonel said. He thought a moment, and signalled for another dry Martini. 'Do you think we might organize a homage and manifestation in some historic place such as San Marco or the old Church at Torcello in favour of our Great Patron, Brusadelli, the Revered One?' 'I doubt if the religious authorities would permit it at this moment.' 'Then let us abandon all ideas of public manifestations for this winter, and work within our cadres, for the good of the Order.' 'I think that is soundest,' the Gran Maestro said. 'We will regroup.' 'And how are you, yourself?' 'Awful,' the Gran Maestro said. 'I have low blood pressure, ulcers and I owe money.' 'Are you happy?' 'All the time,' the Gran Maestro said. 'I like my work very much and I meet extraordinary and interesting characters, also many Belgians. They are what we have instead of the locusts this year. Formerly we had the Germans. What was it Caesar said, 'And the bravest of these are the Belgians.' But not the best dressed. Do you agree?' 'I've seen them quite well costumed in Brussels,' the Colonel said. 'A well-fed, gay capital. Win, lose, or draw.' 'We should have fought in Flanders in the old days.' 'We were not born in the old days,' the Colonel said. 'So we automatically could not have fought then.' 'I wish we could have fought with the Condottieri when all you had to do was out-think them and they conceded. You could think and I would convey your orders.' 'We'd have to take a few towns for them to respect our thinking.' 'We would sack them if they defended them,' the Gran Maestro said. 'What towns would you take?' 'Not this one,' the Colonel said. 'I'd take Vicenza, Bergamo and Verona. Not necessarily in that order.' 'You'd have to take two more.' 'I know,' the Colonel said. He was a general now again and he was happy. 'I figured that I'd by-pass Brescia. It could fall of its own weight.' 'And how are you, Supreme Commander?' the Gran Maestro said, for this taking of towns had pulled him out of his depth. He was at home in his small house in Treviso, close to the fast-flowing river under the old walls. The weeds waved in the current and the fish hung in the shelter of the weeds and rose to insects that touched the water in the dusk. He was at home, too, in all operations that did not involve more than a company and understood them as clearly as he understood the proper serving of a small dining-room; or a large dining-room. But when the Colonel became a general officer again, as he had once been and thought in terms that were as far beyond him as calculus is distant from a man who has only the knowledge of arithmetic, then he was not at home and their contact was strained and he wished the Colonel would return to things they both knew together when they were a lieutenant and a sergeant. 'What would you do about Mantova?' the Colonel asked. 'I do not know, my Colonel. I do not know whom you are fighting, nor what forces are at your disposal.' 'I thought you said we were Condottieri. Based on this town or on Padova.' 'My Colonel,' the Gran Maestro said, and he had diminished in no way, 'I know nothing, truly, about Condottieri. Nor really how they fought then. I only said I would like to fight under you in such times.' 'There aren't any such times any more,' the Colonel said and the spell was broken. What the hell, maybe there never was any spell, the Colonel thought. The hell with you, he said to himself. Cut it out and be a human being when you're half a hundred years old. 'Have another Carpano,' he said to the Gran Maestro. 'My Colonel, you will allow me to refuse because of the ulcers?' 'Yes. Yes. Of course. Boy, what's your name, Giorgio? Another dry Martini. Secco, molto secco e doppio.' Breaking spells, he thought. It is not my trade. My trade is killing armed men. A spell should be armed if I'm to break it. But we have killed many things which were not armed. All right, spell breaker, retract. 'Gran Maestro,' he said. 'You are still Gran Maestro and â€”â€” the Condottieri.' 'They were â€”â€” many years ago, Supreme Commander.' 'Exactly,' the Colonel said. But the spell was broken. 'I'll see you at dinner,' the Colonel said. 'What is there?' 'We will have anything you wish and what we do not have I will send out for.' 'Do you have any fresh asparagus?' 'You know we cannot have it in these months. It comes in April and from Bassano.' 'Then you think of something and I'll eat it,' the Colonel said, 'How many will you be?' the Maitre d'Hotel asked. 'We'll be two,' the Colonel said. 'What time do you close the bistro?' 'We will serve dinner as late as you wish to eat, my Colonel.' 'I'll try to be in at a sound hour,' the Colonel said. 'Good-bye, Gran Maestro,' he said and smiled and gave the Gran Maestro his crooked hand. 'Good-bye, Supreme Commander,' said the Gran Maestro and the spell was existent again and almost complete. But it was not quite complete and the Colonel knew it and he thought: why am I always a bastard and why can I not suspend this trade of arms and be a kind and good man as I would have wished to be. I try always to be just, but I am brusque and I am brutal and it is not that I have erected the defence against brown-nosing my superiors and brown-nosing the world. I should be a better man with less wild boar blood in the small time which remains. We will try it out to-night, he thought. With whom, he thought and where, and God help me not to be bad. 'Giorgio,' he said to the barman, who had a face as white as a leper, but with no bulges and without the silver shine. Giorgio did not really like the Colonel very much, or perhaps he was simply from Piemonte and cared for no one truly; which was understandable in cold people from a border province. Borderers are not trusters and the Colonel knew about this and expected nothing from anyone that they did not have to give. 'Giorgio,' he said to the pale-faced barman. 'Write these down for me, please.' He went out, walking as he had always walked, with a slightly exaggerated confidence, even when it was not needed and, in his always renewed plan of being kind, decent and good, he greeted the concierge, who was a friend, the assistant manager, who spoke Swahili and had been a prisoner of war in Kenya and was a most amiable man, young, full of juice, handsome, perhaps not yet a member of the Order, and experienced. 'And the cavaliere ufficiale who manages this place?' he asked. 'My friend?' 'He is not here,' the assistant manager said. 'For the moment, naturally,' he added. 'Give him my compliments,' the Colonel said. 'And have somebody show me to my room.' 'It is the usual room. You still wish it?' 'Yes. Have you taken care of the Sergeant?' 'He is well taken care of.' 'Good,' said the Colonel. The Colonel proceeded to his room accompanied by the boy who carried his bag. 'This way, my Colonel,' the boy said, when the elevator halted with slight hydraulic inaccuracy at the top floor. 'Can't you run an elevator properly?' the Colonel asked. 'No, my Colonel,' the boy said. 'The current is not stable.' Chapter VIII The colonel said nothing and preceded the boy down the corridor. It was large, wide and high ceilinged and there was a long and distinguished interval between the doors of the rooms on the side of the Grand Canal. Naturally, since it had been a palace, there were no rooms without excellent views, except those which had been made for the servants. The Colonel found the walk long, although it was a very short one and when the waiter, who served the room, appeared, short, dark and with his glass eye in the left eye socket, gleaming, unable to smile his full, true smile as he worked the big key in the lock, the Colonel wished that the door would open more rapidly. 'Open it up,' he said. 'I will, my Colonel,' the waiter said. 'But you know these locks.' Yes, the Colonel thought. I know them, but I wish that he would get it open. 'How are your family?' he said to the waiter, who had swung the door wide so that the Colonel, now entered, was within the room with the high, dark but well-mirrored armoire, the two good beds, the great chandelier and the view, through the still closed windows, on to the wind-beaten water of the Grand Canal. The Canal was grey as steel now in the quick, failing, winter light and the Colonel said, 'Arnaldo, open the windows.' 'There is much wind, my Colonel, and the room is badly heated due to the lack of electric power.' 'Due to the lack of rainfall,' the Colonel said. 'Open the windows. All of them.' 'As you wish, my Colonel.' The waiter opened the windows and the north wind came into the room. 'Please call the desk and ask them to ring this number.' The waiter made the call while the Colonel was in the bathroom. 'The Contessa is not at home, my Colonel,' he said. 'They believe you might find her at Harry's.' 'You find everything on earth at Harry's.' 'Yes, my Colonel. Except, possibly, happiness.' 'I'll damn well find happiness, too,' the Colonel assured him. 'Happiness, as you know, is a movable feast.' 'I am aware of that,' the waiter said. 'I have brought Campari bitters and a bottle of Gordon Gin. May I make you a Campari with gin and soda?' 'You're a good boy,' the Colonel said. 'Where did you bring them from. The bar?' 'No. I bought them while you were away so that you would not have to spend money at the bar. The bar is very costly.' 'I agree,' the Colonel agreed. 'But you should not use your own money on such a project.' 'I took a chance. We have both taken many. The gin was 3200 lire and is legitimate. The Campari was 800.' 'You're a very good boy,' the Colonel told him. 'How were the ducks?' 'My wife still speaks of them. We had never had wild ducks, since they are of such expense, and outside of our way of life. But one of our neighbours told her how to prepare them and these same neighbours ate them with us. I never knew that anything could be so wonderful to eat. When your teeth close on the small slice of meat it is an almost unbelievable delight.' 'I think so, too. There is nothing lovelier to eat than those fat iron-curtain ducks. You know their fly-way is through the great grain fields of the Danube. This is a splinter flight we have here, but they always come the same way since before there were shot-guns.' 'I know nothing about shooting for sport,' the waiter said. 'We were too poor.' 'But many people without money shoot in the Veneto.' 'Yes. Of course. One hears them shoot all night. But we were poorer than that. We were poorer than you can know, my Colonel.' 'I think I can know.' 'Perhaps,' the waiter said. 'My wife also saved all the feathers and she asked me to thank you.' 'If we have any luck the day after to-morrow, we'll get plenty. The big ducks with the green heads. Tell your wife, with luck, there will be good eating ducks, fat as pigs with what they have eaten from the Russians and with beautiful feathers.' 'How do you feel about the Russians, if it is not indiscreet to ask, my Colonel?' 'They are our potential enemy. So, as a soldier, I am prepared to fight them. But I like them very much and I have never known finer people nor people more as we are.' 'I have never had the good fortune to know them.' 'You will, boy. You will. Unless the Honourable Pacciardi stops them on the line of the Piave, which is a river which no longer contains water. It has been siphoned off for hydro-electric projects. Perhaps the Honorable Pacciardi will fight there. But I do not think he will fight for long.' 'I do not know the Honourable Pacciardi.' 'I know him,' said the Colonel. 'Now ask them to ring Harry's and see if the Contessa is there. If not, have them ring the house again.' The Colonel took the drink Arnaldo, the glass-eyed waiter, made him. He did not want it and he knew that it was bad for him. But he took it with his old wild-boar truculence, as he had taken everything all of his life and he moved, still cat-like when he moved, although it was an old cat now, over to the open window and looked out on the great Canal which was now becoming as grey as though Degas had painted it on one of his greyest days. 'Thanks very much for the drink,' the Colonel said and Arnaldo, who was talking into the telephone, nodded and smiled his glass-eyed smile. I wish he did not have to have that glass eye, the Colonel thought. He only loved people, he thought, who had fought or been mutilated. Other people were fine and you liked them and were good friends; but you only felt true tenderness and love for those who had been there and had received the castigation that everyone receives who goes there long enough. So I'm a sucker for cripes, he thought, drinking the unwanted drink. And any son of a bitch who has been hit solidly, as every man will be if he stays, then I love him. Yes, his other, good side said. You love them. I'd rather not love anyone, the Colonel thought. I'd rather have fun. And fun, his good side said to him, you have no fun when you do not love. All right. I love more than any son of the great bitch alive, the Colonel said, but not aloud. Aloud, he said, 'Where are you getting on that call, Arnaldo?' 'Cipriani has not come in,' the waiter said. 'They are expecting him at any moment and I am keeping the line open in case he arrives.' 'A costly procedure,' the Colonel said. 'Get me a reading on who's there so we don't waste time. I want to know exactly who is there.' Arnaldo spoke guardedly into the mouthpiece of the telephone. He covered the mouth of the phone with his hand and said, 'I am talking to Ettore. He says the Barone Alvarito is not there. The Count Andrea is there and he is rather drunk, Ettore says, but not too drunk for you to have fun together. The group of ladies that comes in each afternoon are there and there is a Greek princess, that you know and several people that you do not know. Riff-raff from the American Consulate who have stayed on since noon.' 'Tell him to call back when the riff-raff goes and I'll come over.' Arnaldo spoke into the phone, then turned to the Colonel who was looking out of the window at the Dome of the Dogana, 'Ettore says he will try to move them, but he is afraid Cipriani will not like it.' 'Tell him not to move them. They don't have to work this afternoon and there is no reason why they should not get drunk like any other man. I just don't want to see them.' 'Ettore says he will call back. He told me to tell you he thinks the position will fall of its own weight.' 'Thank him for calling,' the Colonel said. He watched a gondola working up the Canal against the wind and thought, not with Americans drinking. I know they are bored. In this town, too. They are bored in this town. I know the place is cold and their wages are inadequate and what fuel costs. I admire their wives, for the valiant efforts they make to transport Keokuk to Venice, and their children already speak Italian like little Venetians. But no snapshots to-day, Jack. To-day we are giving the snapshots, the bar-room confidences, the unwanted comradely drinks and the tedious woes of the Consular services a miss. 'No second, third or fourth vice-consuls to-day, Arnaldo.' 'There are some very pleasant people from the Consulate.' 'Yeah,' the Colonel said. 'They had a hell of a nice consul here in 1918. Everybody liked him. I'll try to remember his name.' 'You go back a long way back, my Colonel.' 'I go back so damn far back that it isn't funny.' 'Do you remember everything from the old days?' 'Everything,' the Colonel said. 'Carroll was the man's name.' 'I have heard of him.' 'You weren't born then.' 'Do you think it is necessary to have been born at the time to know about things that have happened in this town, my Colonel?' 'You're perfectly correct. Tell me, does everybody always know about everything that happens in this town?' 'Not everybody. But nearly everybody,' the waiter said. 'After all, sheets are sheets and someone has to change them and someone has to wash them. Naturally I do not refer to the sheets in a hotel such as this.' 'I've had some damn good times in my life without sheets.' 'Naturally. But the gondoliers, while they are the most co-operative and, for me, the finest people that we have, speak among themselves.' 'Naturally.' 'Then the clergy. While they would never violate the secrecy of the confessional, talk among themselves.' 'It is to be expected.' 'Their housekeepers talk among themselves.' 'It is their right.' 'Then the waiters,' Arnaldo said. 'People talk at a table as though the waiter were stone-deaf. The waiter, according to his ethics, makes no attempt to ever overhear a conversation. But sometimes he cannot escape from hearing. Naturally, we have our own conversations among ourselves. Never in this hotel of course. I could go on.' 'I believe I get the point.' 'Not to mention the coiffeurs and the hair-dressers.' 'And what's the news from the Rialto now?' 'You will get it all at Harry's except the part you figure in.' 'Do I figure?' 'Everyone knows everything.' 'Well, it's a damn pleasant story.' 'Some people don't understand the Torcello part.' 'I'm damned if I do sometimes myself.' 'How old are you, my Colonel, if it is not too indiscreet to ask?' 'Fifty plus one. Why didn't you find out from the concierge? I fill out a slip there for the Questura.' 'I wanted to hear it from you yourself and to congratulate you.' 'I don't know what you are talking about.' 'Let me congratulate you anyway.' 'I can't accept it.' 'You are very well liked in this city.' 'Thank you. That is a very great compliment.' Just then the telephone buzzed. 'I'll take it,' the Colonel said and heard Ettore's voice say, 'Who speaks?' 'Colonel Cantwell.' 'The position has fallen, my Colonel.' 'Which way did they go?' 'Towards the Piazza.' 'Good. I will be there at once.' 'Do you want a table?' 'In the corner,' said the Colonel and hung up. 'I am off for Harry's.' 'Good hunting.' 'I hunt ducks day after tomorrow before first light in a botte in the marshes.' 'It will be cold, too.' 'I dare say,' the Colonel said and put on his trench coat and looked at his face in the glass of the long mirror as he put on his cap. 'An ugly face,' he said to the glass. 'Did you ever see a more ugly face?' 'Yes,' said Arnaldo. 'Mine. Every morning when I shave.' 'We both ought to shave in the dark,' the Colonel told him and went out the door. Chapter IX As Colonel Cantwell stepped out of the door of the Gritti Palace Hotel he came out into the last sunlight of that day. There was still sunlight on the opposite side of the Square but the gondoliers preferred to be sheltered from the cold wind by lounging in the lee of the Gritti, than to use the last remaining heat of the sun on the wind-swept side of the Square. After noting this, the Colonel turned to the right and walked along the Square to the paved street which turned off on the right. As he turned, he stopped for a moment and looked at the church of Santa Maria del Giglio. What a fine, compact, and yet ready to be air-borne building, he thought. I never realized a small church could look like a P47. Must find out when it was built and who built it. Damn, I wish I might walk around this town all my life. All my life, he thought. What a gag that is. A gag to gag on. A throttle to throttle you with. Come on, boy, he said to himself. No horse named Morbid ever won a race. Besides, he thought, as he looked in the windows of the various shops he passed, the charcuteri with the Parmesan cheeses and the hams from San Daniele and the sausages alla cacciatora and the bottles of good Scotch whisky and real Gordon's gin, the cutlery store, an antique dealer's with some good pieces and some old maps and prints, a second-rate restaurant disguised expensively as one of the first class and then came to the first bridge crossing a feeder canal with steps to be climbed; I don't feel so badly. There is only the buzzing. I remember when that started and I thought perhaps it was seven-year locusts in the trees and I did not like to ask young Lowry but I did. And he answered, 'No, General, I don't hear any crickets or seven-year locusts. The night is perfectly quiet except for the usual noises.' Then, as he climbed, he felt the twinges and coming down the other side, he saw two lovely looking girls. They were beautiful and hatless and poorly but chicly dressed, and they were talking very fast to each other and the wind was blowing their hair as they climbed with their long, easy striding Venetian legs and the Colonel said to himself, 'I'd better quit window gazing along this street and make that next bridge and two squares afterwards you turn due right and keep along it till you are in Harry's.' He did just that, twinging on the bridge, but walking with his same old stride and only seeing, quickly, the people that he passed. There's a lot of oxygen in this air, he thought, as he faced into the wind and breathed deeply. Then he was pulling open the door of Harry's bar and was inside and he had made it again and was at home. At the bar a tall, very tall, man, with a ravaged face of great breeding, merry blue eyes and the long, loose-coupled body of a buffalo wolf said, 'My ancient and depraved Colonel.' 'My wicked Andrea.' They embraced and the Colonel felt the rough texture of Andrea's handsome tweed coat that must have been entering, at least, its twentieth year. 'You look well, Andrea,' the Colonel said. It was a lie and they both knew it. 'I am,' said Andrea, returning the lie. 'I must say I never felt better. You look extraordinarily well, yourself.' 'Thank you, Andrea. Us healthy bastards shall inherit the earth.' 'Very good idea. I must say I wouldn't mind inheriting something these days.' 'You have no kick. You'll inherit well over six feet four of it.' 'Six feet six,' said Andrea. 'You wicked old man. Are you still slaving away at la vie militaire?' 'I don't slave too hard at it,' the Colonel said. 'I'm down to shoot at San Relajo.' 'I know. But don't make jokes in Spanish at this hour. Alvarito was looking for you. He said to tell you he'd be back.' 'Good. Is your lovely wife and are the children well?' 'Absolutely, and they asked me to remember them to you if I saw you. They're down in Rome. There comes your girl. Or one of your girls.' He was so tall he could see into the now almost dark street, but this was a girl you could recognize if it was much darker than it was at this hour. 'Ask her to have a drink with us here before you carry her off to that corner table. Isn't she a lovely girl?' 'She is.' Then she came into the room, shining in her youth and tall striding beauty and the carelessness the wind had made of her hair. She had a pale, almost olive-coloured skin, a profile that could break your, or anyone else's, heart and her dark hair, of an alive texture, hung down over her shoulders. 'Hello, my great beauty,' the Colonel said. 'Oh, oh, hello,' she said. 'I thought I would miss you. I am so sorry to be late.' Her voice was low and delicate and she spoke English with caution. 'Ciao, Andrea,' she said. 'How is Emily and are the children?' 'Probably just the same as when I answered that same question for you at noon.' 'I am so sorry,' she said and blushed. 'I am so excited and I always say the wrong things. What should I say? Have you had a good time here all afternoon?' 'Yes,' said Andrea. 'With my old friend and severest critic.' 'Who is that?' 'Scotch whisky and water.' 'I suppose if he must tease me he must,' she said to the Colonel. 'But you won't tease me, will you?' 'Take him over to that corner table and talk to him. I'm tired of you both.' 'I'm not tired of you,' the Colonel told him. 'But I think it is a good idea. Should we have a drink sitting down, Renata?' 'I'd love to if Andrea isn't angry.' 'I'm never angry.' 'Would you have a drink with us, Andrea?' 'No,' said Andrea. 'Get along to your table. I'm sick of seeing it unoccupied.' 'Good-bye, Carlo. Thanks for the drink we didn't have.' 'Ciao, Ricardo,' Andrea said and that was all. He turned his fine, long, tall back on them and looked into the mirror that is placed behind bars so a man can tell when he is drinking too much and decided that he did not like what he saw there. 'Ettore,' he said. 'Please put this nonsense on my bill.' He walked out after waiting carefully for his coat, swinging into it and tipping the man who brought it exactly what he should be tipped plus twenty per cent. At the corner table, Renata said, 'Do you think we hurt his feelings?' 'No. He loves you and he likes me.' 'Andrea is so nice. And you're so nice.' 'Waiter,' the Colonel called; then asked, 'Do you want a dry Martini, too?' 'Yes,' she said. 'I'd love one.' 'Two very dry Martinis,' the Colonel said. 'Montgomerys. Fifteen to one.' The waiter, who had been in the desert, smiled and was gone and the Colonel turned to Renata. 'You're nice,' he said. 'You're also very beautiful and lovely and I love you.' 'You always say that and I don't know what it means but I like to hear it.' 'How old are you now?' 'Nearly nineteen. Why?' 'And you don't know what it means?' 'No. Why should I? Americans always say it to you before they go away. It seems to be necessary to them. But I love you very much, too, whatever that is.' 'Let's have a fine time,' the Colonel said. 'Let's not think about anything at all.' 'I would like that. I cannot think very well this time of day at any rate.' 'Here are the drinks,' the Colonel said. 'Remember not to say, chin-chin.' 'I remember that from before. I never say chin-chin, nor here's to you, nor bottoms up.' 'We just raise the glass to each other and, if you wish, we can touch the edges.' 'I wish,' she said. The Martinis were icy cold and true Montgomerys and, after touching the edges, they felt them glow happily all through their upper bodies. 'And what have you been doing?' the Colonel asked. 'Nothing. I still wait to go away to school.' 'Where now?' 'God knows. Wherever I go to learn English.' 'Turn your head and raise your chin once for me.' 'You're not making fun?' 'No. I'm not making fun.' She turned her head and raised her chin, without vanity, nor coquetry and the Colonel felt his heart turn over inside him, as though some sleeping animal had rolled over in its burrow and frightened, deliciously, the other animal sleeping close beside. 'Oh, you,' he said. 'Would you ever like to run for Queen of Heaven?' 'That would be sacrilegious.' 'Yes,' he said. 'I suppose it would and I withdraw the suggestion.' 'Richard,' she said. 'No, I can't say it.' 'Say it.' 'No.' The Colonel thought, I order you to say it. And she said, 'Please never look at me like that.' 'I'm sorry,' the Colonel said. 'I had just slipped into my trade unconsciously.' 'And if we were such a thing as married would you practise your trade in the home?' 'No. I swear it. I never have. Not in my heart.' 'With no one?' 'With no one of your sex.' 'I don't like that word your sex. It sounds as though you were practising your trade.' 'I throw my trade out of that God-damn window into the Grand Canal.' 'There,' she said. 'You see how quickly you practise it?' 'All right,' he said. 'I love you and my trade can gently leave.' 'Let me feel your hand,' she said. 'It's all right. You can put it on the table.' 'Thank you,' the Colonel said. 'Please don't,' she said. 'I wanted to feel it because all last week, every night, or I think nearly every night, I dreamed about it and it was a strange mixed-up dream and I dreamed it was the hand of Our Lord.' 'That's bad. You oughtn't to do that.' 'I know it. That's just what I dreamed.' 'You aren't on the junk, are you?' 'I don't know what you mean and please don't make fun when I tell you something true. I dreamed just as I say.' 'What did the hand do?' 'Nothing. Or maybe that is not true. Mostly it was just a hand.' 'Like this one?' The Colonel asked, looking at the mis-shapen hand with distaste and remembering the two times that had made it that way. 'Not like. It was that one. May I touch it carefully with my fingers if it does not hurt?' 'It does not hurt. Where it hurts is in the head, the legs and the feet. I don't believe there's any sensation in that hand.' 'You're wrong,' she said. 'Richard. There is very much sensation in that hand.' 'I don't like to look at it much. You don't think we could skip it?' 'Of course. But you don't have to dream about it.' 'No. I have other dreams.' 'Yes. I can imagine. But I dream lately about this hand. Now that I have touched it carefully, we can talk about funny things if you like. What is there funny we should talk about?' 'Let's look at the people and discuss them.' 'That's lovely,' she said. 'And we won't do it with malice. Only with our best wit. Yours and mine.' 'Good,' the Colonel said. 'Waiter, Ancora due Martini.' He did not like to call for Montgomerys in a tone that could be overheard because there were two obvious Britishers at the next table. The male might have been wounded, the Colonel thought, although, from his looks, it seems unlikely. But God help me to avoid brutality. And look at Renata's eyes, he thought. They are probably the most beautiful of all the beautiful things she has with the longest honest lashes I have ever seen and she never uses them for anything except to look at you honestly and straight. What a damn wonderful girl and what am I doing here anyway? It is wicked. She is your last and true and only love, he thought, and that's not evil. It is only unfortunate. No, he thought, it is damned fortunate and you are very fortunate. They sat at a small table in the corner of the room and on their right there were four women at a larger table. One of the women was in mourning; a mourning so theatrical that it reminded the Colonel of the Lady Diana Manners playing the nun in Max Reinhardt's 'The Miracle'. This woman had an attractive, plump, naturally gay face and her mourning was incongruous. At the table there was another woman who had hair three times as white as hair can be, the Colonel thought she, also, had a pleasant face. There were two other women whose faces meant nothing to the Colonel. 'Are they lesbians?' he asked the girl. 'I do not know,' she said. 'They are all very nice people.' 'I should say they are lesbians. But maybe they are just good friends. Maybe they are both. It means nothing to me and it was not a criticism.' 'You are nice when you are gentle.' 'Do you suppose the word gentleman derives from a man who is gentle?' 'I do not know.' the girl said, and she ran her fingers very lightly over the scarred hand. 'But I love you when you are gentle.' 'I'll try very hard to be gentle,' the Colonel said. 'Who do you suppose that son of a bitch is at the table beyond them?' 'You don't stay gentle very long,' the girl said. 'Let us ask Ettore.' They looked at the man at the third table. He had a strange face like an over-enlarged, disappointed weasel or ferret. It looked as pock-marked and as blemished as the mountains of the moon seen through a cheap telescope and, the Colonel thought, it looked like Goebbels's face, if Herr Goebbels had ever been in a plane that burned and not been able to bale out before the fire reached him. Above this face, which was ceaselessly peering, as though the answer might be found by enough well directed glances and by queries, there was black hair that seemed to have no connection with the human race. The man looked as though he had been scalped and then the hair replaced. Very interesting, the Colonel thought. Can he be a compatriot? Yes, he must. A little spit ran out of the corner of his mouth as he spoke, peeringly, with the elderly, wholesome looking woman who was with him. She looks like anybody's mother in an illustration in The Ladies' Home Journal, the Colonel thought. The Ladies' Home Journal was one of the magazines received regularly at the Officers's Club in Trieste and the Colonel looked through it when it came. It is a wonderful magazine, he thought, because it combines sexology and beautiful foods. It makes me hungry both ways. But who do you suppose that character is? He looks like a caricature of an American who has been run one half way through a meat chopper and then been boiled, slightly, in oil. I'm not being so gentle, he thought. Ettore, with his emaciated face and his love of joking and fundamental and abiding disrespect, came over and the Colonel said, 'Who is that spiritual character?' Ettore shook his head. The man was short and dark with glossy black hair that did not seem to go with his strange face. He looked, the Colonel thought, as though he had forgotten to change his wig as he grew older. Has a wonderful face though, the Colonel thought. Looks like some of the hills around Verdun. I don't suppose he could be Goebbels and he picked up that face in the last days when they were all playing at Gotterdammerung. Komm' Susser Tod, he thought. Well they sure bought themselves a nice big piece of Susser Tod at the end. 'You don't want a nice Susser Tod sandwich do you Miss Renata?' 'I don't think so,' the girl said. 'Though I love Bach and I am sure Cipriani could make one.' 'I was not talking against Bach,' the Colonel said. 'I know it.' 'Hell,' the Colonel said. 'Bach was practically a co-belligerent. As you were,' he added. 'I don't think we have to talk against me.' 'Daughter,' the Colonel said. 'When will you learn that I might joke against you because I love you?' 'Now,' she said. 'I've learned it. But you know it's fun not to joke too rough.' 'Good. I've learned it.' 'How often do you think of me during the week?' 'All of the time.' 'No. Tell me truly.' 'All of the time. Truly.' 'Do you think it is this bad for everyone?' 'I wouldn't know,' the Colonel said. 'That's one of the things I would not know.' 'I hope it's not this bad for everyone. I had no idea it could be this bad.' 'Well you know now.' 'Yes,' the girl said. 'I know now. I know now and for keeps and for always. Is that the correct way to say it?' 'I know now is enough,' the Colonel said. 'Ettore, that character with the inspiring face and the nice looking woman with him doesn't live at the Gritti does he?' 'No,' Ettore said. 'He lives next door but he goes to the Gritti sometimes to eat.' 'Good,' the Colonel said. 'It will be wonderful to see him if I should ever be down-hearted. Who is the woman with him? His wife? His mother? His daughter?' 'There you have me,' Ettore said. 'We haven't kept track of him in Venice. He has aroused neither love, hate, dislike, fear nor suspicion. Do you really want to know anything about him? I could ask Cipriani.' 'Let us skip him,' the girl said. 'Is that how you say it?' 'Let's skip him,' the Colonel said. 'When we have so little time, Richard. He is rather a waste of time.' 'I was looking at him as at a drawing by Goya. Faces are pictures, too.' 'Look at mine and I will look at yours. Please skip the man. He didn't come here to do anyone any harm.' 'Let me look at your face and you not look at mine.' 'No,' she said. 'That's not fair. I have to remember yours all week.' 'And what do I do?' the Colonel asked her. Ettore came over, unable to avoid conspiracy and, having gathered his intelligence rapidly and as a Venetian should, said: 'My colleague who works at his hotel, says that he drinks three or four highballs and then writes vastly and fluently far into the night.' 'I daresay that makes marvellous reading.' 'I daresay,' Ettore said. 'But it was hardly the method of Dante.' 'Dante was another vieux con,' the Colonel said. 'I mean as a man. Not as a writer.' 'I agree,' Ettore said. 'I think you will find no one, outside of Firenze, who has studied his life who would not agree.' 'Eff Florence,' the Colonel said. 'A difficult manoeuvre,' Ettore said. 'Many have attempted it but very few have succeeded. Why do you dislike it, my Colonel?' 'Too complicated to explain. But it was the depot,' he said deposito, 'of my old regiment when I was a boy.' 'That I can understand. I have my own reasons for disliking it, too. You know a good town?' 'Yes,' said the Colonel. 'This one. A part of Milano; and Bologna. And Bergamo.' 'Cipriani has a large store of vodka in case the Russians should come,' Ettore said, loving to joke rough. 'They'll bring their own vodka, duty free.' 'Still I believe Cipriani is prepared for them.' 'Then he is the only man who is,' the Colonel said. 'Tell him not to take any cheques from junior officers on the Bank of Odessa and thank you for the data on my compatriot. I won't take more of your time.' Ettore left and the girl turned towards him and looked in his old steel eyes and put both her hands on his bad one and said, 'You were quite gentle.' 'And you are most beautiful and I love you.' 'It's nice to hear it anyway.' 'What are we going to do about dinner?' 'I will have to call my home and find out if I can come out.' 'Why do you look sad now?' 'Do I?' 'Yes.' 'I am not, really. I am as happy as I ever am. Truly. Please believe me, Richard. But how would you like to be a girl nineteen years old in love with a man over fifty years old that you knew was going to die?' 'You put it a little bluntly,' the Colonel said. 'But you are very beautiful when you say it.' 'I never cry,' the girl said. 'Never. I made a rule not to. But I would cry now.' 'Don't cry,' the Colonel said. 'I'm gentle now and the hell with the rest of it.' 'Say once again that you love me.' 'I love you and I love you and I love you.' 'Will you do your best not to die?' 'Yes.' 'What did the doctor say?' 'So-so.' 'Not worse?' 'No,' he lied. 'Then let us have another Martini,' the girl said. 'You know I never drank a Martini until we met.' 'I know. But you drink them awfully well.' 'Shouldn't you take the medicine?' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'I should take the medicine.' 'May I give it to you?' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'You may give it to me.' They continued to sit at the table in the corner and some people went out and others came in. The Colonel felt a little dizzy from the medicine and he let it ride. That's the way it always is, he thought. To hell with it. He saw the girl watching him and he smiled at her. It was an old smile that he had been using for fifty years, ever since he first smiled and it was still as sound as your grandfather's Purdey shot-gun. I guess my older brother has that, he thought. Well, he could always shoot better than I could and he deserves it. 'Listen, Daughter,' he said. 'Don't be sorry for me.' 'I'm not. Not at all. I just love you.' 'It isn't much of a trade is it?' He said oficio instead of trade, because they spoke Spanish together, too, when they left French and when they did not wish to speak English before other people. Spanish is a rough language, the Colonel thought, rougher than a corncob sometimes. But you can say what you mean in it and make it stick. 'Es un oficio bastante malo,' he repeated, 'loving me.' 'Yes. But it is the only one I have.' 'Don't you write any more poetry?' 'It was young girl poetry. Like young girl painting. Everyone is talented at a certain age.' At what age do you become old in this country, the Colonel thought. No one is ever old in Venice, but they grow up very fast. I grew up very rapidly in the Veneto myself and I was never as old as I was at twenty-one. 'How is your mother?' he asked lovingly. 'She is very well. She does not receive and she sees almost no one because of her sorrow.' 'Do you think she would mind if we had a baby?' 'I don't know. She is very intelligent, you know. But I would have to marry someone, I suppose. I don't really want to.' 'We could be married.' 'No,' she said. 'I thought it over and I thought we should not. It is just a decision as the one about crying.' 'Maybe you make wrong decisions. Christ knows I've made a few and too many men are dead from when I was wrong.' 'I think, perhaps, you exaggerate. I don't believe you made many wrong decisions.' 'Not many,' the Colonel said. 'But enough. Three is plenty in my trade and I made all three.' 'I'd like to know about them.' 'They'd bore you,' the Colonel told her. 'They beat the hell out of me to remember them. So what would they do to some outsider?' 'Am I an outsider?' 'No. You're my true love. My last and only and true love.' 'Did you make them early or late? The decisions.' 'I made them early. In the middle. And late.' 'Wouldn't you tell me about them? I would like to have a share in your sad trade.' 'The hell with them,' the Colonel said. 'They were made and they've all been paid for. Only you can't pay for that.' 'Can you tell me about that and why?' 'No,' the Colonel said. And that was the end of that. 'Then let's have fun.' 'Let's,' the Colonel said. 'With our one and only life.' 'Maybe there are others. Other lives.' 'I don't think so,' the Colonel said. 'Turn your head sideways, beauty.' 'Like this?' 'Like that,' the Colonel said. 'Exactly like that.' So, the Colonel thought, here we come into the last round and I do not know even the number of the round. I have loved but three women and have lost them thrice. You lose them the same way you lose a battalion; by errors of judgment; orders that are impossible to fulfil and through impossible conditions. Also through brutality. I have lost three battalions in my life and three women and now I have a fourth and loveliest and where the hell does it end? You tell me, General, and, incidentally, while we are discussing the matter and it is frank discussion of the situation and in no sense a Council of War, as you have so often pointed out to me General: GENERAL WHERE IS YOUR CAVALRY? I have thought so, he said to himself. The Commanding Officer does not know where his cavalry is and his cavalry are not completely accurate as to their situation, nor their mission and they will, some of them, enough, muck off as cavalry have always mucked off in all the wars since they, the Cavalry, had the big horses. 'Beauty,' he said, 'Ma trÃ¨s chÃ¨re et bien aimÃ©e. I am very dull and I am sorry.' 'You are never dull, to me, and I love you and I only wish we could be cheerful to-night.' 'We damn well will be,' said the Colonel. 'Do you know anything particular we should be cheerful about?' 'We might be cheerful about us, and about the town. You've often been very cheerful.' 'Yes,' the Colonel agreed. 'I have been.' 'Don't you think we could do it once more?' 'Sure. Of course. Why not?' 'Do you see the boy with the wave in his hair, that is natural, and he only pushes it a little, skilfully, to be more handsome?' 'I see him,' the Colonel said. 'He is a very good painter, but he has false teeth in front because he was a little bit pÃ©dÃ©raste once and other pÃ©dÃ©rastes attacked him one night on the Lido when there was a full moon.' 'How old are you?' 'I will be nineteen.' 'How do you know this?' 'I know it from the Gondoliere. This boy is a very good painter, for now. There aren't any really good painters now. But with false teeth, now, in his twenty-fifth year, what a thing.' 'I love you very truly,' the Colonel said. 'I love you very truly, too. Whatever that means in American. I also love you in Italian, against all my judgment and all of my wishes.' 'We shouldn't wish for too God-damn much,' the Colonel said. 'Because we are always liable to get it.' 'I agree,' she said. 'But I would like to get what I wish for now.' Neither of them said anything and then the girl said, 'That boy, he is a man now, of course, and goes with very many women to hide what he is, painted my portrait once. You can have it if you like.' 'Thank you,' the Colonel said. 'I would love it.' 'It is very romantic. My hair is twice as long as it has ever been and I look as though I were rising from the sea without the head wet. Actually, you rise from the sea with the hair very flat and coming to points at the end. It is almost the look of a very nearly dead rat. But Daddy paid him adequately for the portrait, and, while it is not truly me, it is the way you like to think of me.' 'I think of you when you come from the sea too.' 'Of course. Very ugly. But you might like to have this portrait for a souvenir.' 'Your lovely mother would not mind?' 'Mummy would not mind. She would be glad to be rid of it, I think. We have better pictures in the house.' 'I love you and your mother both very much.' 'I must tell her,' the girl said. 'Do you think that pock-marked jerk is really a writer?' 'Yes. If Ettore says so. He loves to joke but he does not lie. Richard, what is a jerk? Tell me truly.' 'It is a little rough to state. But I think it means a man who has never worked at his trade (oficio) truly, and is presumptuous in some annoying way.' 'I must learn to use the term properly.' 'Don't use it,' the Colonel said. Then the Colonel asked, 'When do I get the portrait?' 'To-night if you wish it. I'll have someone wrap it and send it from the house. Where will you hang it?' 'In my quarters.' 'And no one will come in and make remarks and speak badly of me?' 'No. They damn well will not. Also I'll tell them it is a portrait of my daughter.' 'Did you ever have a daughter?' 'No. I always wanted one.' 'I can be your daughter as well as everything else.' 'That would be incest.' 'I don't think that would be so terrible in a city as old as this and that has seen what this city has seen.' 'Listen, Daughter.' 'Good,' she said. 'That was fine. I liked it.' 'All right,' the Colonel said and his voice was thickened a little. 'I liked it, too.' 'Do you see now why I lore you when I know better than to do it?' 'Look, Daughter. Where should we dine?' 'Wherever you like.' 'Would you eat at the Gritti?' 'Of course.' 'Then call the house and ask for permission.' 'No. I decided not to ask permission but to send word where I was dining. So they would not worry.' 'But do you really prefer the Gritti?' 'I do. Because it is a lovely restaurant and it is where you live and anyone can look at us that wants to.' 'When did you get like that?' 'I have always been like that. I have never cared what anyone thought, ever. Nor have I ever done anything that I was ashamed of except tell lies when I was a little girl and be unkind to people.' 'I wish we could be married and have five sons,' the Colonel said. 'So do I,' the girl said. 'And send them to the five corners of the world.' 'Are there five corners to the world?' 'I don't know,' she said. 'It sounded as though there were when I said it. And now we are having run again, aren't we?' 'Yes, Daughter,' the Colonel said. 'Say it again. Just as you said it.' 'Yes, Daughter.' 'Oh,' she said. 'People must be very complicated. Please may I take your hand?' 'It's so damned ugly and I dislike looking at it.' 'You don't know about your hand.' 'That's a matter of opinion,' he said. 'I'd say you were wrong, Daughter.' 'Maybe I am wrong. But we're having fun again and whatever the bad thing was is gone now.' 'It's gone the way the mist is burned off the hollows in broken ground when the sun comes out,' the Colonel said. 'And you're the sun.' 'I want to be the moon, too.' 'You are,' the Colonel told her. 'Also any particular planet that you wish to be and I will give you an accurate location of the planet. Christ, Daughter, you can be a God-damn constellation if you like. Only that's an airplane.' 'I'll be the moon. She has many troubles, too.' 'Yes. Her sorrows come regularly. But she always fills before she wanes.' 'She looks so sad to me sometimes across the Canal, that I cannot stand it.' 'She's been around a long time,' the Colonel said. 'Do you think we should have one more Montgomery?' the girl asked and the Colonel noticed that the British were gone. He had been noticing nothing but her lovely face. I'll get killed sometime that way, he thought. On the other hand it is a form of concentration I suppose. But it is damned careless. 'Yes,' he said. 'Why not?' 'They make me feel very good,' the girl said. 'They have a certain effect on me, too, the way Cipriani makes them.' 'Cipriani is very intelligent.' 'He's more than that. He's able.' 'Some day he'll own all Venice.' 'Not quite all,' the Colonel disagreed. 'He'll never own you.' 'No,' she said. 'Nor will anyone else unless you want me.' 'I want you, Daughter. But I don't want to own you.' 'I know it,' the girl said. 'And that's one more reason why I love you.' 'Let's get Ettore and have him call up your house. You can tell them about the portrait.' 'You are quite correct. If you want the portrait to-night, I must speak to the butler to have it wrapped and sent. I will also ask to speak to Mummy and tell her where we are dining, and, if you like, I will ask her permission.' 'No,' the Colonel said. 'Ettore, two Montgomerys, super Montgomerys, with garlic olives, not the big ones, and please call the home of this lady and let her know when you have completed the communication. And all of this as rapidly as possible.' 'Yes, my Colonel.' 'Now, Daughter, let us resume the having of the fun.' 'It was resumed when you spoke,' she said. Chapter X They were walking, now, along the right side of the street that led to the Gritti. The wind was at their backs and it blew the girl's hair forward. The wind parted her hair in the back and blew it forward about her face. They were looking in the shop windows and the girl stopped in front of the lighted window of a jewellery shop. There were many good pieces of old jewellery in the window and they stood and looked at them and pointed out the best ones to each other, unclasping their hands to do so. 'Is there anything you really want? I could get it in the morning. Cipriani would loan me the money.' 'No,' she said. 'I do not want anything but I notice that you never give me presents.' 'You are much richer than I am. I bring you small things from the PX and I buy you drinks and meals.' 'And take me in gondolas and to lovely places in the country.' 'I never thought you wanted presents of hard stones.' 'I don't. It is just the thought of giving and then one looks at them and thinks about them when they are worn.' 'I'm learning,' the Colonel said. 'But what could I buy you on Army pay that would be like your square emeralds?' 'But don't you see. I inherited them. They came from my grandmother, and she had them from her mother who had them from her mother. Do you think it is the same to wear stones that come from dead people?' 'I never thought about it.' 'You can have them if you like, if you like stones. To me they are only something to wear like a dress from Paris. You don't like to wear your dress uniform, do you?' 'No.' 'You don't like to carry a sword, do you?' 'No, repeat, no.' 'You are not that kind of a soldier and I am not that sort of girl. But some time give me something lasting that I can wear and be happy each time I wear it.' 'I see,' the Colonel said. 'And I will.' 'You learn fast about things you do not know,' the girl said. 'And you make lovely quick decisions. I would like you to have the emeralds and you could keep them in your pocket like a lucky piece, and feel them if you were lonely.' 'I don't put my hands much in my pockets when I'm working. I usually twirl a stick, or something, or point things out with a pencil.' 'But you could put your hand in your pocket only once in a long time and feel them.' 'I'm not lonely when I'm working. I have to think too hard to ever be lonely.' 'But you are not working now.' 'No. Only preparing the best way to be overrun.' 'I'm going to give them to you anyway. I'm quite sure Mummy will understand. Also I won't need to tell her for quite a long time. She keeps no check on my things. I'm sure my maid would never tell her.' 'I don't think I should take them.' 'You should, please, to give me pleasure.' 'I'm not sure it's honourable.' 'That is like not being sure whether you are a virgin. What you do to give pleasure to another whom you love is most honourable.' 'All right,' the Colonel said. 'I will take them for better or for worse.' 'Now you say thank you,' the girl said and slipped them into his pocket as quickly and ably as a jewel thief might. 'I brought them with me because I have been thinking and deciding about this all week.' 'I thought you thought about my hand.' 'Don't be surly, Richard. And you should never be stupid. It is your hand you touch them with. Didn't you think of that?' 'No. And I was stupid. What would you like from that window?' 'I would like that small Negro with the ebony face and the turban made of chip diamonds with the small ruby on the crown of the turban. I should wear it as a pin. Everyone wore them in the old days in this city and the faces were those of their confidential servants. I have coveted this for a long time, but I wanted you to give it to me.' 'I'll send it in the morning.' 'No. Give it to me when we have lunch before you go.' 'Right,' the Colonel said. 'Now we must walk or we will be too late for dinner.' They started to walk, arm through arm, and as they went up the first bridge the wind lashed at them. When the twinge came, the Colonel said to himself, the hell with that. 'Richard,' the girl said. 'Put your hand in your pocket to please me and feel them.' The Colonel did. 'They feel wonderful,' he said. Chapter XI They came in, out of the wind and the cold, through the main entrance of the Gritti Palace Hotel, into the light and warmth of the lobby. 'Good evening, Contessa,' the concierge said. 'Good evening, my Colonel. It must be cold outside.' 'It is,' the Colonel said, and did not add any of the rough or obscene phrases about the extent of the cold, or the force of the wind, that he could ordinarily have employed, for their mutual pleasure when speaking, alone, with the concierge. As they entered the long hallway that led to the big stairs and to the elevator, leaving, on your right, the entrance to the bar, the doorway on to the Grand Canal, and the entrance to the dining-room, the Gran Maestro came out of the bar. He was wearing a formal white jacket, cut long, and he smiled at them and said, 'Good evening, my Countess. Good evening, my Colonel.' 'Gran Maestro,' the Colonel said. The Gran Maestro smiled and, still bowing, said, 'We are dining in the bar at the far end. There is no one here now in the winter time and the dining-room is too big. I have saved your table. We have a very fine lobster if you would like him to commence with.' 'Is he really fresh?' 'I saw him this morning when he came from the market in a basket. He was alive and a dark green and completely unfriendly.' 'Would you like lobster, Daughter, to start your dinner?' The Colonel was conscious of using the word, and so was the Gran Maestro, and so was the girl. But to each one it meant a different thing. 'I wanted to have him for you in case any pescecani came in. They are down now to gamble at the Lido. I was not trying to sell him.' 'I would love some lobster,' the girl said. 'Cold, and with mayonnaise. The mayonnaise rather stiff.' She said this in Italian. 'It isn't too expensive?' she said to the Colonel, seriously. 'Ay hija mia,' the Colonel said. 'Feel in your right pocket,' she said. 'I'll see that he is not too expensive,' the Gran Maestro said. 'Or I'll buy him myself. I could get him quite easily with a week's wages.' 'Sold to TRUST,' the Colonel said, this being the code designation of the task force occupying Trieste. 'He only costs me a day's wages.' 'Put your hand in your right hand pocket and feel very rich,' the girl said. The Gran Maestro had sensed this was a private joke and had gone; silently. He was happy about the girl, whom he respected and admired, and he was happy for his Colonel. 'I am rich,' the Colonel said. 'But if you tease me about them, I will give them back, and on the linen tablecloth, and in public.' He was teasing rough in his turn; throwing in the counter-attack without even thinking. 'No, you won't,' she said. 'Because you love them already.' 'I would take anything I love and throw it off the highest cliff you ever saw and not wait to hear it bounce.' 'No, you wouldn't,' the girl said. 'You would not throw me off any high cliffs.' 'No,' the Colonel agreed. 'And forgive me for talking badly.' 'You didn't talk very badly and I didn't believe it anyway,' the girl told him. 'Now should I go to the women's room to comb my hair and make myself presentable, or should I come up to your room?' 'Which do you wish?' 'To come to your room, of course, and see how you live and how things are there.' 'What about the hotel?' 'Everything is known in Venice anyway. But it is also known who my family are and that I am a good girl. Also they know it is you and it is I. We have some credit to exhaust.' 'Good,' the Colonel said. 'By stairs or elevator?' 'By elevator,' she said, and he heard the change in her voice. 'You can call a boy or we can run it ourselves.' 'We run it ourselves,' the Colonel said. 'I checked out on elevators long ago.' It was a good ride with a slight bump, and a rectification at the end, and the Colonel thought: Checked out, eh? You better be checked out again. The corridor was now not simply beautiful, but exciting, and putting the key into the lock was not a simple process, but a rite. 'Here it is,' the Colonel said when he swung the door open. 'What there is of it.' 'It is charming,' the girl said. 'But it is awfully cold with the windows open.' 'I'll close them.' 'No, please. Leave them open if you like it that way.' The Colonel kissed her and felt her wonderful, long, young, lithe and properly built body against his own body, which was hard and good, but beat-up, and as he kissed her he thought of nothing. They kissed for a long time, standing straight, and kissing true, in the cold of the open windows that were on to the Grand Canal. 'Oh,' she said. Then, 'Oh.' 'We owe nothing,' the Colonel said. 'Not a thing.' 'Will you marry me and will we have the five sons?' 'I will! I will!' 'The thing is that, would you?' 'Of course.' 'Kiss me once again and make the buttons of your uniform hurt me but not too much.' They stood there and kissed each other true. 'I have a disappointment for you, Richard,' she said. 'I have a disappointment about everything.' She said it as a flat statement and it came to the Colonel in the same way as a message came from one of the three battalions, when the battalion commander spoke the absolute truth and told you the worst. 'You are positive?' 'Yes.' 'My poor Daughter,' he said. Now there was nothing dark about the word and she was his daughter, truly, and he pitied her and loved her. 'No matter,' he said. 'You comb yourself and make a new mouth and all that, and we will have a good dinner.' 'Say once more, first, that you love me and make the buttons very tight.' 'I love you,' the Colonel said quite formally. Then he whispered into her ear as gently as he knew how to whisper, as his whisper was when they are fifteen feet away and you are a young lieutenant on a patrol, 'I love you only, my best and last and only and one true love.' 'Good,' she said, and kissed him hard so he could feel the sweet salt of the blood inside his lip. And I like that too, he thought. 'Now I will comb my hair and make my mouth new and you can watch me.' 'Do you want me to shut the windows?' 'No,' she said. 'We will do it all in the cold.' 'Who do you love?' 'You,' she said. 'And we don't have too much luck, do we?' 'I don't know,' the Colonel said. 'Go ahead and comb your hair.' The Colonel went into the bathroom to wash up for dinner. The bathroom was the only disappointing part of the room. Due to the exigencies of the Gritti having been built as a palace, there had been no site for bathrooms at the time of building, and, later, when they were introduced, they had been built down the corridor and those entitled to use them gave due warning beforehand and water was heated and towels laid out. This bathroom had been cut, arbitrarily, from a corner of the room and it was a defensive, rather than an attacking bathroom, the Colonel felt. Washing, and forced to look in the mirror to check any traces of lipstick, he regarded his face. It looks as though it had been cut out of wood by an indifferent craftsman, he thought. He looked at the different welts and ridges that had come before they had plastic surgery, and at the thin, only to be observed by the initiate, lines of the excellent plastic operations after head wounds. Well, that is what I have to offer as a gueule or a faÃ§ade, he thought1 It is a damn poor offer. The only thing is that it is tanned, and that takes some of the curse off of it. But, Christ what an ugly man. He did not notice the old used steel of his eyes nor the small long extending laugh wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, nor that his broken nose was like a gladiator's in the oldest statues. Nor did he notice his basically kind mouth which could be truly ruthless. The hell with you, he said to the mirror. You beat-up, miserable. Should we rejoin the ladles? He went out from the bathroom into the room, and he was as young as at his first attack. Every worthless thing had been left in the bathroom. As always, he thought. That's the place for it. OÃ¹ sont les neiges d'antan? OÃ¹ sont les neiges d'autrefois? Dans le pissoir toute la chose comme Ã§a. The girl, whose first name was Renata, had the doors of the tall armoire open. They were all mirrored inside and she was combing her hair. She was not combing it for vanity, nor to do to the Colonel what she knew it could and would do. She was combing it with difficulty and without respect, and, since it was very heavy hair and as alive as the hair of peasants, or the hair of the beauties of the great nobility, it was resistant to the comb. 'The wind made it very tangled,' she said. 'Do you love me still?' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'May I help you?' 'No, I've done it all my life.' 'You could stand sidewise.' 'No. All contours are for our five sons and for your head to rest on.' 'I was only thinking of the face,' the Colonel said. 'But thank you for calling my attention. My attention has been faulty again.' 'I am over bold.' 'No,' the Colonel said. 'In America, they make such things of wire and of sponge-rubber, such as you use in the seats of tanks. You never know there, whether there is any truth in the matter, unless you are a bad boy, as I am.' 'Here it is not that way,' she said, and, with the comb, swung her now parted hair forward so that it came below the line of her cheek and, slanting back, hung over her shoulders. 'Do you like it neat?' 'It's not too neat but it is damn lovely.' 'I could put it up and all that sort of thing if you value neatness. But I cannot manage hairpins and it seems so silly.' Her voice was so lovely and it always reminded him of Pablo Casals playing the 'cello that it made him feel as a wound does that you think you cannot bear. But you can bear anything, he thought. 'I love you very much the way you are,' the Colonel said. 'And you are the most beautiful woman I have ever known, or seen, ever in paintings by good painters.' 'I wonder why the portrait has not come.' 'The portrait is lovely to have,' the Colonel said, and now he was a General again without thinking of it. 'But it is like skinning a dead horse.' 'Please don't be rough,' the girl said. 'I don't feel at all like being rough to-night.' 'I slipped into the jargon of my sale mÃ¨tier.' 'No,' she said. 'Please put your arms around me, gently and well. Please. It is not a dirty trade. It is the oldest and the best, although most people who practise it are unworthy.' He held her as tight as he could without hurting and she said, 'I would not have you be a lawyer nor a priest. Nor sell things. Nor be a great success. I love you to be in your trade and I love you. Please whisper to me if you wish.' The Colonel whispered; holding her tight, and with his heart broken, honestly and fairly, in his whisper that was as barely audible as a silent dog whistle heard close to the ear, 'I love you, devil. And you're my daughter, too. And I don't care about our losses because the moon is our mother and our father. And now let's go down to dinner.' He whispered this last so low that it was inaudible to anyone who did not love you. 'Yes,' the girl said. 'Yes. But kiss me once more first.' Chapter XII They were at their table in the far corner of the bar, where the Colonel had both his flanks covered, and he rested solidly against the corner of the room. The Gran Maestro knew about this, since he had been an excellent sergeant in a good company of infantry, in a first-rate regiment, and he would no more have seated his Colonel in the middle of a room than he would have taken up a stupid defensive position. 'The lobster,' the Gran Maestro said. The lobster was imposing. He was double the size a lobster should be, and his unfriendliness had gone with the boiling, so that now he looked a monument to his dead self; complete with protruding eyes and his delicate, far-extended antennae that were for knowing what rather stupid eyes could not tell him. He looks a little bit like Georgie Patton, the Colonel thought. But he probably never cried in his life when he was moved. 'Do you think that he will be tough?' he asked the girl in Italian. 'No,' the Gran Maestro assured them, still bowing with the lobster. 'He's truly not tough. He's only big. You know the type.' 'All right,' the Colonel said. 'Serve him.' 'And what will you drink?' 'What do you want, Daughter?' 'What you want?' 'Capri Bianco,' the Colonel said. 'Secco and really cold.' 'I have it ready,' said the Gran Maestro. 'We are having fun,' the girl said. 'We are having it again and without sorrow. Isn't he an imposing lobster?' 'He is,' the Colonel answered. 'And he better damn well be tender.' 'He will be,' the girl told him. 'The Gran Maestro doesn't lie. Isn't it wonderful to have people who do not lie?' 'Very wonderful and quite rare,' the Colonel said. 'I was thinking just now of a man named Georgie Patton who possibly never told the truth in his life.' 'Do you ever lie?' 'I've lied four times. But each time I was very tired. That's not an excuse,' he added. 'I lied a lot when I was a little girl. But mostly it was making up stories. Or I hope so. But I have never lied to my own advantage.' 'I have,' said the Colonel. 'Four times.' 'Would you have been a general if you had not lied?' 'If I had lied as others lied, I would have been a three-star general.' 'Would it make you happier to be a three-star general?' 'No,' said the Colonel. 'It would not.' 'Put your right hand, your real hand, in your pocket once and tell me how you feel.' The Colonel did so. 'Wonderful,' he said. 'But I have to give them back you know.' 'No. Please, no.' 'We won't go into it now.' Just then the lobster was served. It was tender, with the peculiar slippery grace of that kicking muscle which is the tail, and the claws were excellent; neither too thin, nor too fat. 'A lobster fills with the moon,' the Colonel told the girl. 'When the moon is dark he is not worth eating.' 'I didn't know that.' 'I think it may be because, with the full moon, he feeds all night. Or maybe it is that the full moon brings him feed.' 'They come from the Dalmatian coast do they not?' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'That's your rich coast in fish. Maybe I should say our rich coast.' 'Say it,' the girl said. 'You don't know how important things that are said are.' 'They are a damn sight more important when you put them on paper.' 'No,' the girl said. 'I don't agree. The paper means nothing unless you say them in your heart.' 'And what if you haven't a heart, or your heart is worthless?' 'You have a heart and it is not worthless.' I would sure as hell like to trade it in on a new one, the Colonel thought. I do not see why that one, of all the muscles, should fail me. But he said nothing of this, and put his hand in his pocket. 'They feel wonderful,' he said. 'And you look wonderful.' 'Thank you,' she said. 'I will remember that all week.' 'You could always just look in the glass.' 'The mirror bores me,' she said. 'Putting on lipstick and moving your lips over each other to get it spread properly and combing your too heavy hair is not a life for a woman, or even a girl alone, who loves someone. When you want to be the moon and various stars and live with your man and have five sons, looking at yourself in the mirror and doing the artifices of a woman is not very exciting.' 'Then let us be married at once.' 'No,' she said. 'I had to make a decision about that, as about the other different things. All week long is my time to make decisions.' 'I make them, too,' the Colonel told her. 'But I am very vulnerable on this.' 'Let's not talk about it. It makes a sweet hurt, but I think we would do better to find out what the Gran Maestro has for meat. Please drink your wine. You haven't touched it.' 'I'll touch it now,' the Colonel said. He did and it was pale and cold like the wines of Greece, but not resinous, and its body was as full and as lovely as that of Renata. 'It's very like you.' 'Yes. I know. That's why I wanted you to taste it.' 'I'm tasting it,' the Colonel said. 'Now I will drink a full glass.' 'You're a good man.' 'Thank you,' the Colonel said. 'I'll remember that all week and try to be one.' Then he said, 'Gran Maestro.' When the Gran Maestro came over, happy, conspiratorial, and ignoring his ulcers, the Colonel asked him, 'What sort of meat have you that is worth our eating?' 'I'm not quite sure I know,' the Gran Maestro said. 'But I will check. Your compatriot is over there in hearing distance. He would not let me seat him in the far corner.' 'Good,' the Colonel said. 'We'll give him something to write about.' 'He writes every night, you know. I've heard that from one of my colleagues at his hotel.' 'Good,' the Colonel said. 'That shows that he is industrious even if he has outlived his talents.' 'We are all industrious,' the Gran Maestro said. 'In different ways.' 'I will go and check on what there actually is among the meats.' 'Check carefully.' 'I am industrious.' 'You are also damn sagacious.' The Gran Maestro was gone and the girl said, 'He is a lovely man and I love how fond he is of you.' 'We are good friends,' the Colonel said. 'I hope he has a good steak for you.' 'There is one very good steak,' the Gran Maestro said, reappearing. 'You take it, Daughter. I get them all the time at the mess. Do you want it rare?' 'Quite rare, please.' 'Al sangue,' the Colonel said, 'as John said when he spoke to the waiter in French. Crudo, bleu, or just make it very rare.' 'It's rare,' the Gran Maestro said. 'And you, my Colonel?' 'The scaloppine with Marsala, and the cauliflower braised with butter. Plus an artichoke vinaigrette if you can find one. What do you want, Daughter?' 'Mashed potatoes and a plain salad.' 'You're a growing girl.' 'Yes. But I should not grow too much nor in the wrong directions.' 'I think that handles it,' the Colonel said. 'What about a fiasco of Valpolicella?' 'We don't have fiascos. This is a good hotel, you know. It comes in bottles.' 'I forgot,' the Colonel said. 'Do you remember when it cost thirty centesimi the litre?' 'And we would throw the empty fiascos at the station guards from the troop trains?' 'And we would throw all the left over grenades away and bounce them down the hillside coming back from the Grappa?' 'And they would think there was a break-through when they would see the bursts and you never shaved, and we wore the fiamme nere on the grey, open jackets with the grey sweaters?' 'And I drank grappa and could not even feel the taste?' 'We must have been tough then,' the Colonel said. 'We were tough then,' the Gran Maestro said. 'We were bad boys then, and you were the worst of the bad boys.' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'I think we were rather bad boys. You forgive this will you, Daughter?' 'You haven't a picture of then, have you?' 'No. There weren't any pictures except with Mr. d'Annunzio in them. Also most of the people turned out badly.' 'Except for us,' the Gran Maestro said. 'Now I must go and see how the steak marches.' The Colonel, who was a sub-lieutenant again now, riding in a camion, his face dust, until only his metallic eyes showed, and they were red-rimmed and sore, sat thinking. The three key points, he thought. The massif of Grappa with Assalone and Pertica and the hill I do not remember the name of on the right. That was where I grew up, he thought, and all the nights I woke sweating, dreaming I would not be able to get them out of the trucks. They should not have gotten out, ever, of course. But what a trade it is. 'In our army, you know,' he told the girl, 'practically no generals have ever fought. It is quite strange and the top organization dislikes those who have fought.' 'Do generals really fight?' 'Oh, yes. When they are captains and lieutenants. Later, except in retreats, it is rather stupid.' 'Did you fight much? I know you did. But tell me.' 'I fought enough to be classified as a fool by the great thinkers.' 'Tell me.' 'When I was a boy, I fought against Erwin Rommel half way from Cortina to the Grappa, where we held. He was a captain then and I was an acting captain; really a sub-lieutenant.' 'Did you know him?' 'No. Not until after the war when we could talk together. He was very nice and I liked him. We used to ski together.' 'Did you like many Germans?' 'Very many. Ernst Udet I liked the best.' 'But they were in the wrong.' 'Of course. But who has not been?' 'I never could like them or take such a tolerant attitude as you do, since they killed my father and burned our villa on the Brenta and the day I saw a German officer shooting pigeons with a shotgun in the Piazzo San Marco.' 'I understand,' the Colonel said. 'But please, Daughter, you try to understand my attitude too. When we have killed so many we can afford to be kind.' 'How many have you killed?' 'One hundred and twenty-two sures. Not counting possibles.' 'You had no remorse?' 'Never.' 'Nor bad dreams about it?' 'Nor bad dreams. But usually strange ones. Combat dreams, always, for a while after combat. But then strange dreams about places mostly. We live by accidents of terrain, you know. And terrain is what remains in the dreaming part of your mind.' 'Don't you ever dream about me?' 'I try to. But I can't.' 'Maybe the portrait will help.' 'I hope so,' the Colonel said. 'Please don't forget to remind me to give back the stones.' 'Please don't be cruel.' 'I have my small necessities of honour in the same proportions as we have our great and enveloping love. You cannot have the one without the other.' 'But you could give me privileges.' 'You have them,' the Colonel said. 'The stones are in my pocket.' The Gran Maestro came then with the steak and the scaloppine and the vegetables. They were brought by a sleek-headed boy who believed in nothing; but was trying hard to be a good second waiter. He was a member of the Order. The Gran Maestro served adroitly and with respect both for the food, and those that were to eat it. 'Now eat,' he said. 'Uncork that Valpolicella,' he said to the boy who had the eyes of an unbelieving spaniel. 'What do you have on that character?' the Colonel asked him, referring to his pitted compatriot, sitting chawing at his food, while the elderly woman with him ate with suburban grace. 'You should tell me. Not me you.' 'I never saw him before to-day,' the Colonel said. 'He's hard to take with food.' 'He condescends to me. He speaks bad Italian assiduously. He goes everywhere in Baedeker, and he has no taste in either food or wine. The woman is nice. I believe she is his aunt. But I have no real information.' 'He looks like something we could do without.' 'I believe we could. In a pinch.' 'Does he speak of us?' 'He asked me who you were. He was familiar with the Contessa's name and had book-visited several palaces that had belonged to the family. He was impressed by your name, Madam, which I gave to impress him.' 'Do you think he will put us in a book?' 'I'm sure of it. He puts everything in a book.' 'We ought to be in a book,' the Colonel said. 'Would you mind, Daughter?' 'Of course not,' the girl said. 'But I'd rather Dante wrote it.' 'Dante isn't around,' the Colonel said. 'Can you tell me anything about the war?' the girl asked. 'Anything that I should be permitted to know?' 'Sure. Anything you like.' 'What was General Eisenhower like?' 'Strictly the Epworth League. Probably that is unjust too. Also complicated by various other influences. An excellent politician. Political General. Very able at it.' 'The other leaders?' 'Let us not name them. They've named themselves enough in their memoirs. Mostly extremely plausible out of something called the Rotary Club that you would never have heard of. In this club, they have enamelled buttons with their first names and you are fined if you call them by their proper names. Never fought. Ever.' 'Were there no good ones?' 'Yes, many. Bradley, the schoolmaster, and many others. Give you Lightning Joe as a good one. Very good.' 'Who was he?' 'Commanded the Seventh Corps when I was there. Very sound. Rapid. Accurate. Now chief of staff.' 'But what about the great leaders we heard about like the Generals Montgomery and Patton?' 'Forget them, Daughter. Monty was a character who needed fifteen to one to move, and then moved tardily.' 'I always supposed he was a great General.' 'He was not,' the Colonel said. 'The worst part was he knew it. I have seen him come into an hotel and change from his proper uniform into a crowd-catching kit to go out in the evening to animate the populace.' 'Do you dislike him?' 'No. I simply think he is a British General. Whatever that means. And don't you use the term.' 'But he beat General Rommel.' 'Yes. And you don't think anyone else had softened him up? And who can't win with fifteen to one? When we fought here, when we were boys, the Gran Maestro and I, we won for one whole year with three to four against one and we won each one. Three main bad ones. That is why we can make jokes and not be solemn. We had something over one hundred and forty thousand dead that year. That is why we can speak gaily and without pomposity.' 'It is such a sad science; if it is a science,' the girl said. 'I hate the war monuments, though I respect them.' 'I do not like them either. Nor the process which led to their construction. Have you ever seen that end of the thing?' 'No. But I would like to know.' 'Better not know,' the Colonel said. 'Eat your steak before it gets cold and forgive me for talking about my trade.' 'I hate it but I love it.' 'I believe we share the same emotions,' the Colonel said. 'But what is my pitted compatriot thinking three tables down?' 'About his next book, or about what it says in Baedeker.' 'Should we go and ride in a gondola in the wind after we have dined?' 'That would be lovely.' 'Should we tell the pitted man that we are going? I think he has the same pits on his heart and in his soul and maybe in his curiosity.' 'We tell him nothing,' the girl said. 'The Gran Maestro can convey him any information we wish.' Then she chewed well and solidly on her steak and said, 'Do you think it is true that men make their own faces after fifty.' 'I hope not. Because I would not sign for mine.' 'You,' she said. 'You.' 'Is the steak good?' the Colonel asked. 'It's wonderful. How are your scaloppine?' 'Very tender and the sauce is not at all sweet. Do you like the vegetables?' 'The cauliflower is almost crisp; like celery.' 'We should have some celery. But I don't think there is any or the Gran Maestro would have brought it.' 'Don't we have fun with food? Imagine if we could eat together always.' 'I've suggested it.' 'Let's not talk about that.' 'All right,' the Colonel said. 'I've made a decision too. I'm going to chuck the army and live in this town, very simply, on my retirement pay.' 'That's wonderful. How do you look in civilian clothes?' 'You've seen me.' 'I know it, my dear. I said it for a joke. You make rough jokes sometimes too, you know.' 'I'll look all right. That is if you have a tailor here who can cut clothes.' 'There isn't one here, but there is in Rome. Can we drive together to Rome to get the clothes?' 'Yes. And we will live outside the town at Viterbo and only go in for the fittings and for dinner in the evening. Then we'll drive back in the night.' 'Will we see cinema people and speak about them with candour and perhaps not have a drink with them?' 'We'll see them by the thousands.' 'Will we see them being married for the second and third time and then being blessed by the Pope?' 'If you go in for that kind of thing.' 'I don't,' the girl said. 'That's one reason that I cannot marry you.' 'I see,' the Colonel said. 'Thank you.' 'But I will love you, whatever that means, and you and I know what it means very well, as long as either of us is alive and after.' 'I don't think you can love very much after you, yourself, are dead,' the Colonel said. He started to eat the artichoke taking a leaf at a time, and dipping them, heavy side down, into the deep saucer of sauce vinaigrette. 'I don't know whether you can either,' the girl said. 'But I will try. Don't you feel better to be loved?' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'I feel as though I were out on some bare-assed hill where it was too rocky to dig, and the rocks all solid, but with nothing jutting, and no bulges, and all of a sudden instead of being there naked, I was armoured. Armoured and the eighty-eights not there.' 'You should tell that to our writer friend with the craters of the moon face so he could write it to-night.' 'I ought to tell it to Dante if he was around,' the Colonel, suddenly gone as rough as the sea when a line squall comes up, said. 'I'd tell him what I'd do if I were shifted, or ascended, into an armoured vehicle under such circumstances.' Just then the Barone Alvarito came into the dining-room. He was looking for them and, being a hunter, he saw them instantly. He came over to the table and kissed Renata's hand, saying, 'Ciao, Renata.' He was almost tall, beautifully built in his town clothes, and he was the shyest man the Colonel had ever known. He was not shy from ignorance, nor from being ill at ease, nor from any defect. He was basically shy, as certain animals are, such as the Bongo that you will never see in the jungle, and that must be hunted with dogs. 'My Colonel,' he said. He smiled as only the truly shy can smile. It was not the easy grin of the confident, nor the quick slashing smile of the extremely durable and the wicked. It had no relation with the poised, intently used smile of the courtesan or the politician. It was the strange, rare smile which rises from the deep, dark pit, deeper than a well, deep as a deep mine, that is within them. 'I can only stay a moment. I came to tell you that it looks quite good for the shoot. The ducks are coming in heavily from the north. There are many big ducks. The ones you like,' he smiled again. 'Sit down, Alvarito. Please.' 'No,' the Barone Alvarito said. 'We can meet at the garage at two-thirty if you like? You have your car?' 'Yes.' 'That makes it very good. Leaving at that hour, we will have time to see the ducks in the evening.' 'Splendid,' the Colonel said. 'Ciao, then, Renata. Good-bye, my Colonel. Until two-thirty.' 'We knew each other as children,' the girl said. 'But he was about three years older. He was born very old.' 'Yes. I know. He is a good friend of mine.' 'Do you think your compatriot has looked him up in Baedeker?' 'I wouldn't know,' the Colonel said. 'Gran Maestro,' he asked, 'did my illustrious compatriot look up the Barone in Baedeker?' 'Truly, my Colonel. I have not seen him pull his Baedeker during the meal.' 'Give him full marks,' the Colonel said. 'Now look. I believe that the Valpolicella is better when it is newer. It is not a grand vin and bottling it and putting years on it only adds sediment. Do you agree?' 'I agree.' 'Then what should we do?' 'My Colonel, you know that in a Great Hotel, wine must cost money. You cannot get Pinard at the Ritz. But I suggest that we get several fiascos of the good. You can say they come from the Contessa Renata's estates and are a gift. Then I will have them decanted for you. This way, we will have better wine and make an impressive saving. I will explain it to the manager if you like. He is a very good man.' 'Explain it to him,' the Colonel said. 'He's not a man who drinks labels either.' 'Agreed.' 'In the meantime you might as well drink this. It is very good you know.' 'It is,' the Colonel said. 'But it isn't Chambertin.' 'What did we use to drink?' 'Anything,' the Colonel said. 'But now I seek perfection. Or, rather, not absolute perfection, but perfection for my money.' 'I seek it, too,' the Gran Maestro said. 'But rather vainly.' 'What do you want for the end of the meal?' 'Cheese,' the Colonel said. 'What do you want, Daughter?' The girl had been quiet and a little withdrawn, since she had seen Alvarito. Something was going on in her mind, and it was an excellent mind. But, momentarily, she was not with them. 'Cheese,' she said. 'Please.' 'What cheese?' 'Bring them all and we'll look at them,' the Colonel said. The Gran Maestro left and the Colonel said, 'What's the matter, Daughter?' 'Nothing. Never anything. Always nothing.' 'You might as well pull out of it. We haven't time for such luxuries.' 'No. I agree. We will devote ourselves to the cheese.' 'Do I have to take it like a corn cob?' 'No,' she said, not understanding the colloquialism, but understanding exactly what was meant, since it was she who had been doing the thinking. 'Put your right hand in your pocket.' 'Good,' the Colonel said. 'I will.' He put his right hand in his pocket and felt what was there, first with the tips of his fingers, and then with the insides of his fingers, and then with the palm of his hand; his split hand. 'I'm sorry,' she said. 'And now we begin the good part of it again. We will dedicate ourselves to the cheese with happiness.' 'Excellent,' the Colonel said. 'I wonder what cheeses he has?' 'Tell me about the last war,' the girl said. 'Then we will ride in our gondola in the cold wind.' 'It was not very interesting,' the Colonel said. 'To us, of course, such things are always interesting. But there were only three, maybe four, phases that really interested me.' 'Why?' 'We were fighting a beaten enemy whose communications had been destroyed. We destroyed many divisions on paper, but they were ghost divisions. Not real ones. They had been destroyed by our tactical aviation before they ever got up. It was only really difficult in Normandy, due to the terrain, and when we made the break for Georgie Patton's armour to go through and held it open on both sides.' 'How do you make a break for armour to go through? Tell me, please.' 'First you fight to take a town that controls all the main roads. Call the town St. Lo. Then you have to open up the roads by taking other towns and villages. The enemy has a main line of resistance, but he cannot bring up his divisions to counter-attack because the fighter-bombers catch them on the roads. Does this bore you? It bores the hell out of me.' 'It does not bore me. I never heard it said understandably before.' 'Thank you,' the Colonel said. 'Are you sure you want more of the sad science?' 'Please,' she said. 'I love you, you know, and I would like to share it with you.' 'Nobody shares this trade with anybody,' the Colonel told her. 'I'm just telling you how it works. I can insert anecdotes to make it interesting, or plausible.' 'Insert some, please.' 'The taking of Paris was nothing,' the Colonel said. 'It was only an emotional experience. Not a military operation. We killed a number of typists and the screen the Germans had left, as they always do, to cover their withdrawal. I suppose they figured they were not going to need a hell of a lot of office workers any more and they left them as soldiers.' 'Was it not a great thing?' 'The people of Leclerc, another jerk of the third or fourth water, whose death I celebrated with a magnum of Perrier-Jouet Brut 1942, shot a great number of rounds to make it seem important and because we had given them what they had to shoot with. But it was not important.' 'Did you take part in it?' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'I think I could safely say, yes.' 'Did you have no great impressions of it? After all, it was Paris and not everyone has taken it.' 'The French, themselves, had taken it four days before. But the grand plan of what we called SHAEF, Supreme, get that word, Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, which included all the military politicians of the rear, and who wore a badge of shame in the form of a flaming something, while we wore a four-leafed clover as a designation, and for luck, had a master plan for the envelopment of the city. So we could not simply take it. 'Also we had to wait for the possible arrival of General or Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery who was unable to close, even, the gap at Falaise and found the going rather sticky and could not quite get there on time.' 'You must have missed him,' the girl said. 'Oh, we did,' the Colonel said. 'No end.' 'But was there nothing noble or truly happy about it?' 'Surely,' the Colonel told her. 'We fought from Bas Meudon, and then the Porte de Saint Cloud, through streets I knew and loved and we had no deads and did as little damage as possible. At the Etoile I took Elsa Maxwell's butler prisoner. It was a very complicated operation. He had been denounced as a Japanese sniper. A new thing. Several Parisians were alleged to have been killed by him. So we sent three men to the roof where he had taken refuge and he was an Indo-China boy.' 'I begin to understand a little. But it is disheartening.' 'It is always disheartening as hell. But you are not supposed to have a heart in this trade.' 'But do you think it was the same in the time of the Grand Captains?' 'I am quite sure it was worse.' 'But you got your hand honourably?' 'Yes. Very honourably. On a rocky, bare-assed hill.' 'Please let me feel it,' she said. 'Just be careful around the centre,' the Colonel said. 'It's split there and it still cracks open.' 'You ought to write,' the girl said. 'I mean it truly. So someone would know about such things.' 'No,' the Colonel disagreed. 'I have not the talent for it and I know too much. Almost any liar writes more convincingly than a man who was there.' 'But other soldiers wrote.' 'Yes. Maurice de Saxe. Frederick the Great. Mr. T'sun Su.' 'But soldiers of our time.' 'You use the word our with facility. I like it though.' 'But didn't many modern soldiers write?' 'Many. But did you ever read them?' 'No. I have read mostly the classics and I read the illustrated papers for the scandals. Also, I read your letters.' 'Burn them,' the Colonel said. 'They are worthless.' 'Please. Don't be rough.' 'I won't. What can I tell you that won't bore you?' 'Tell me about when you were a General.' 'Oh, that,' he said and motioned to the Gran Maestro to bring champagne. It was Roederer Brut '42 and he loved it. 'When you are a General you live in a trailer and your Chief of Staff lives in a trailer, and you have bourbon whisky when other people do not have it. Your Gs live in the C.P. I'd tell you what Gs are, but it would bore you. I'd tell you about G1, G2, G3, G4, G5 and on the other side there is always Kraut-6. But it would bore you. On the other hand, you have a map covered with plastic material, and on this you have three regiments composed of three battalions each. It is all marked in coloured pencil. 'You have boundary lines so that when the battalions cross their boundaries they will not then fight each other. Each battalion is composed of five companies. All should be good, but some are good, and some are not so good. Also you have divisional artillery and a battalion of tanks and many spare parts. You live by co-ordinates.' He paused while the Gran Maestro poured the Roederer Brut '42. 'From Corps,' he translated, unlovingly, cuerpo d'Armata, 'they tell you what you must do, and then you decide how to do it. You dictate the orders or, most often, you give them by telephone. You ream out people you respect, to make them do what you know is fairly impossible, but is ordered. Also, you have to think hard, stay awake late and get up early.' 'And you won't write about this? Not even to please me?' 'No,' said the Colonel. 'Boys who were sensitive and cracked and kept all their valid first impressions of their day of battle, or their three days, or even their four, write books. They are good books but can be dull if you have been there. Then others write to profit quickly from the war they never fought in. The ones who ran back to tell the news. The news is hardly exact. But they ran quickly with it. Professional writers who had jobs that prevented them from fighting wrote of combat that they could not understand, as though they had been there. I do not know what category of sin that comes under. 'Also a nylon-smooth captain of the Navy who could not command a cat-boat wrote about the intimate side of the truly Big Picture. Everybody will write their book sooner or later. We might even draw a good one. But I don't write, Daughter.' He motioned for the Gran Maestro to fill the glasses. 'Gran Maestro,' he said. 'Do you like to fight?' 'No.' 'But we fought?' 'Yes. Too much.' 'How is your health?' 'Wonderful except for the ulcers and a small cardiac condition.' 'No,' the Colonel said, and his heart rose and he felt it choke him. 'You only told me about the ulcers.' 'Well, you know now,' the Gran Maestro said and did not finish the sentence and he smiled his best and clearest smile that came as solid as the sun rises. 'How many times?' The Gran Maestro held up two fingers as a man might do giving odds where he had credit, and all the betting was on the nod. 'I'm ahead of you,' the Colonel said. 'But let's not be macabre. Ask Donna Renata if she wishes more of this excellent wine.' 'You did not tell me there were more,' the girl said. 'You owe it to me to tell me.' 'There has been nothing since we were together last.' 'Do you think it breaks for me? If so, I would come and simply be with you and care for you.' 'It's just a muscle,' the Colonel said. 'Only it is the main muscle. It works as perfectly as a Rolex Oyster Perpetual. The trouble is you cannot send it to the Rolex representative when it goes wrong. When it stops, you just do not know the time. You're dead.' 'Don't please talk about it.' 'You asked me,' the Colonel said. 'And that pitted man with the caricature face? He has no such thing?' 'Of course not,' the Colonel told her. 'If he is a mediocre writer he will live for ever.' 'But you're not a writer. How do you know this?' 'No,' the Colonel said. 'By the grace of God. But I've read several books. We have a lot of time to read when we are unmarried. Not as much as the merchant marine maybe. But plenty. I can tell one writer from another and I tell you that a mediocre writer has a long span of life. They ought to all draw longevity pay.' 'Could you tell me any anecdotes, and we stop talking about this, which is my true sorrow?' 'I can tell you hundreds of them. All true.' 'Tell me just one. Then we will finish this wine and then go in the gondola.' 'Do you think you will be warm enough?' 'Oh, I'm sure I will.' 'I don't know what to tell you,' the Colonel said. 'Everything about war bores those who have not made it. Except the tales of the liars.' 'I would like to know about the taking of Paris.' 'Why? Because I told you that you looked like Marie Antoinette in the tumbril?' 'No. I was complimented by that and I know we are a little alike in profile. But I have never been in any tumbril, and I would like to hear about Paris. When you love someone and he is your hero, you like to hear about the places and the things.' 'Please turn your head,' the Colonel said, 'and I will tell you. Gran Maestro is there any more in that wretched bottle?' 'No,' the Gran Maestro answered. 'Then bring another.' 'I have one already iced.' 'Good. Serve it. Now, Daughter, we parted from the column of the General Leclerc at Clamart. They went to Montrouge and the Porte d'Orleans and we went directly to Bas Meudon and secured the bridge of the Porte de Saint Cloud. Is this too technical and does it bore you?' 'No.' 'It would be better with a map.' 'Go on.' 'We secured the bridge and established a bridgehead on the other side of the river and we threw the Germans, living and dead, who had defended the bridge, into the Seine River,' he stopped. 'It was a token defence of course. They should have blown it. We threw all these Germans into the River Seine. They were nearly all office workers, I believe.' 'Go on.' 'The next morning, we were informed that the Germans had strong points at various places, and artillery on Mount Valerien, and that tanks were roaming the streets. A portion of this was true. We were also requested not to enter too rapidly as the General Leclerc was to take the city. I complied with this request and entered as slowly as I could.' 'How do you do that?' 'You hold up your attack two hours and you drink champagne whenever it is offered to you by patriots, collaborators or enthusiasts.' 'But was there nothing wonderful nor great, the way it is in books?' 'Of course. There was the city itself. The people were very happy. Old general officers were walking about in their moth-balled uniforms. We were very happy, too, not to have to fight.' 'Did you not have to fight at all?' 'Only three times. Then not seriously.' 'But was that all you had to fight to take such a city?' 'Daughter, we fought twelve times from Ranbouillet to enter the city. But only two of them were worth describing as fights. Those at Toussus le Noble and at Le Buc. The rest was the necessary garnishing of a dish. I really did not need to fight at all except at those two places.' 'Tell me some true things about fighting.' 'Tell me you love me.' 'I love you,' the girl said. 'You can publish it in the Gazzettina if you like. I love your hard, flat body and your strange eyes that frighten me when they become wicked. I love your hand and all your other wounded places.' 'I better try to tell you something pretty good,' the Colonel said. 'First I can tell you that I love you, Period.' 'Why don't you buy some good glass?' the girl asked, suddenly. 'We could go to Murano together.' 'I don't know anything about glass.' 'I could teach you. It would be fun.' 'We lead too nomadic a life for good glass.' 'But when you retire and live here.' 'We'll get some then.' 'I wish that that was now.' 'So do I, except that I go duck shooting to-morrow and that to-night is to-night.' 'Can I come duck shooting?' 'Only if Alvarito asks you.' 'I can make him ask me.' 'I doubt that.' 'It isn't polite to doubt what your daughter says when she is old enough not to lie.' 'All right, Daughter. I withdraw the doubt.' 'Thank you. For that I will not go and be a nuisance. I will stay in Venice and go to Mass with Mother and my aunt and my great-aunt and visit my poors. I am an only child so I have many duties.' 'I always wondered what you did.' 'That's what I do. Also, I'll have my maid wash my head and give me a manicure and a pedicure.' 'You can't do that because the shoot is on Sunday.' 'Then I'll do that on Monday. On Sunday, I will read all the illustrated papers including the outrageous ones.' 'Maybe they'll have pictures of Miss Bergman. Do you still want to be like her?' 'Not any more,' the girl said. 'I want to be like me only much, much better and I want to have you love me.' 'Also,' she said suddenly and un-maskingly, 'I want to be like you. Can I be like you a little while to-night?' 'Of course,' the Colonel said. 'In what town are we anyway?' 'Venice,' she said. 'The best town, I think.' 'I quite agree. And thank you for not asking me for more war episodes.' 'Oh, you are going to have to tell them to me later.' 'Have to?' the Colonel said, and the cruelty and resolution showed in his strange eyes as clearly as when the hooded muzzle of the gun of a tank swings towards you. 'Did you say have to, Daughter?' 'I said it. But I did not mean it in that way. Or, if I did wrong, I am sorry. I meant will you please tell me more true episodes later? And explain me the things I do not understand?' 'You can use have to if you want, Daughter. The hell with it.' He smiled and his eyes were as kind as they ever were, which was not too kind, as he knew. But there was nothing now that he could do about it except to try to be kind to his last and true and only love. 'I don't really mind, Daughter. Please believe me. I know about command and, at your age, I used to take considerable pleasure in exercising it.' 'But I don't want to command,' the girl said. In spite of her resolution not to cry, her eyes were wet. 'I wish to serve you.' 'I know. But you wish to command, too. There's nothing wrong in that. All people such as us have it.' 'Thank you for the such as us.' 'It wasn't hard to say,' the Colonel said. 'Daughter,' he added. Just then the concierge came to the table and said, 'Excuse me, my Colonel. There is a man outside, I believe he is a servant of yours, my lady, with quite a large package which he says is for the Colonel. Should I keep it in the storeroom or have it sent to your room?' 'To my room,' the Colonel said. 'Please,' the girl said. 'Can't we look at it here? We don't care about anyone here, do we?' 'Have it unwrapped and brought in here.' 'Very good.' 'Later, you may have it taken with great care to my room and have it wrapped, solidly, for transport at noon to-morrow.' 'Very good, my Colonel.' 'Are you excited to see it?' the girl asked. 'Very,' said the Colonel. 'Gran Maestro, some more of that Roederer, please, and please place a chair in such a position that we may view a portrait. We are devotees of the pictorial arts.' 'There's no more Roederer cold,' the Gran Maestro said. 'But if you would like some Perrier-Jouetâ€”â€”' 'Bring it,' the Colonel said and added, 'Please.' 'I don't talk like Georgie Patton,' the Colonel told her. 'I don't have to. And besides he's dead.' 'Poor man.' 'Yes. Poor man all his life. Although quite rich in money and with a lot of armour.' 'Do you have anything against armour?' 'Yes. Most of the people inside of it. It makes men into bullies which is the first step towards cowardice; true cowardice, I mean. Perhaps it is a little complicated by claustrophobia.' Then he looked at her and smiled and regretted taking her beyond her depth, as you might take a new swimmer on a shallow, shelving beach, into too deep water; and he sought to reassure her. 'You forgive me, Daughter. Much of what I say is unjust. But it is truer than the things that you will read in Generals' memoirs. After a man gets one star, or more, the truth becomes as difficult for him to attain as the Holy Grail was in our ancestors' time.' 'But you were a general officer.' 'Not for too damn long,' the Colonel said. 'Now captains,' the General said, 'they know the exact truth and they can mostly tell it to you. If they can't, you reclassify them.' 'Would you reclassify me if I lied?' 'It would depend on what you lied about.' 'I'm not going to lie about anything. I don't want to be reclassified. It sounds horrible.' 'It is,' the Colonel said. 'And you send them back to have it done to them with eleven different copies of why it should be done, every one of which you sign.' 'Did you reclassify many?' 'Plenty.' The concierge came into the room with the portrait, carrying it in its big frame, much as a ship moves when she is carrying too much sail. 'Get two chairs,' the Colonel said to the second waiter, 'and put them there. See that the canvas does not touch the chairs. And hold it so it does not slip.' Then to the girl he said, 'We'll have to change that frame.' 'I know,' she said. 'It was not my choice. Take it unframed with you and we'll choose a good frame next week. Now look at it. Not at the frame. At what it says, or does not say, of me.' It was a beautiful portrait; neither cold, nor snobbish, nor stylized, nor modern. It was the way you would want your girl painted if Tintoretto were still around and, if he were not around, you settled for Velasquez. It was not the way either of them painted. It was simply a splendid portrait painted, as they sometimes are, in our time. 'It's wonderful,' the Colonel said. 'It is truly lovely.' The concierge and the second waiter were holding it and looking at it around the edges. The Gran Maestro was admiring fully. The American, two tables down, was looking at it with his journalistic eyes, wondering who painted it. The back of the canvas was to the other diners. 'It is wonderful,' the Colonel said. 'But you can't give me that.' 'I already have,' the girl said. 'I'm sure my hair was never that long over my shoulders.' 'I think it probably was.' 'I could try to let it get that long if you want.' 'Try,' the Colonel said. 'You great beauty you. I love you very much. You and you portrayed on canvas.' 'Tell the waiters if you like. I'm sure it won't come as a great shock to them.' 'Take the canvas upstairs to my room,' the Colonel said to the concierge. 'Thank you very much for bringing it in. If the price is right, I am going to buy it.' 'The price is right,' the girl said to him. 'Should we have them take it and the chairs down and make a special showing of it for your compatriot? The Gran Maestro could tell him the address of the painter and he could visit the picturesque studio.' 'It is a very lovely portrait,' the Gran Maestro said. 'But it should be taken to the room. One should never let Roederer or Perrier-Jouet do the talking.' 'Take it to the room, please.' 'You said please without a pause before it.' 'Thank you,' the Colonel said. 'I am very deeply moved by the portrait and I am not entirely responsible for what I say.' 'Let's neither of us be responsible.' 'Agreed,' the Colonel said. 'The Gran Maestro is really very responsible. He always was.' 'No,' the girl said. 'I think he did not only from responsibility but from malice. We all have malice, you know, of some kind or another in this town. I think perhaps he did not want the man to have even a journalist's look into happiness.' 'Whatever that is.' 'I learned that phrase from you and now you have re-learned it back from me.' 'That's the way it goes,' the Colonel said. 'What you win in Boston you lose in Chicago.' 'I don't understand that at all.' 'Too hard to explain,' the Colonel said. Then, 'No. Of course it isn't. Making things clear is my main trade. The hell with being too hard to explain. It is like professional football, calcio. What you win in Milano you lose in Torino.' 'I don't care about football.' 'Neither do I,' the Colonel said. 'Especially not about the Army and Navy game and when the very high brass speaks in terms of American football so they can understand, themselves, what they are talking of.' 'I think we will have a good time to-night. Even under the circumstances, whatever they are.' 'Should we take this new bottle in the gondola?' 'Yes,' the girl said. 'But with deep glasses. I'll tell the Gran Maestro. Let's get our coats and go.' 'Good. I'll take some of this medicine and sign for the G.M. and we'll go.' 'I wish it was me taking the medicine instead of you.' 'I'm glad as hell it isn't,' the Colonel said. 'Should we pick our gondola or have them bring one to the landing?' 'Let's gamble and have them bring one to the landing. What do we have to lose?' 'Nothing, I guess. Probably nothing.' Chapter XIII They went out the side door of the hotel to the imbarcadero and the wind hit them. The light from the hotel shone on the blackness of the gondola and made the water green. She looks as lovely as a good horse or as a racing shell, the Colonel thought. Why have I never seen a gondola before? What hand or eye framed that darked symmetry? 'Where should we go?' the girl asked. Her hair, in the light from the hotel door and window, as she stood on the dock by the black gondola, was blowing back in the wind, so she looked like the figure-head on a ship. The rest of it, too, the Colonel thought. 'Let's just ride through the park,' the Colonel said. 'Or through the Bois with the top down. Let him take us out to Armenonville.' 'Will we go to Paris?' 'Sure,' the Colonel said. 'Tell him to take us for an hour where the going is easiest. I don't want to drive him into that wind.' 'The tide is quite high with this wind,' the girl said. 'Some of our places he couldn't get under the bridges. May I tell him where to go?' 'Of course, Daughter.' 'Stow that ice bucket aboard,' the Colonel said to the second waiter, who had come out with them. 'The Gran Maestro said to tell you, as you embarked, that this bottle of wine was his present.' 'Thank him properly and tell him he can't do that.' 'He had better go into the wind a little first,' the girl said. 'Then I know how he should go.' 'The Gran Maestro sent this,' the second waiter said. It was a folded, old U.S.O.D. blanket. Renata was talking to the gondoliere, her hair blowing. The gondoliere wore a heavy blue navy sweater and he was bare-headed too. 'Thank him,' the Colonel said. He slipped a bill into the second waiter's hand. The second waiter returned it. 'You already made the notation on the check. Neither you nor I nor the Gran Maestro are starving.' 'What about the moglie and the bambini?' 'I don't have that. Your mediums smacked our house in Treviso.' 'I'm sorry.' 'You needn't be,' the second waiter said. 'You were a foot soldier as I was.' 'Permit me to be sorry.' 'Sure,' the second waiter said. 'And what the hell difference does it make? Be happy, my Colonel and be happy, my Lady.' They got down into the gondola and there was the same magic, as always, of the light hull and the sudden displacement that you made and then the trimming in the dark privacy and then the second trimming, as the gondoliere started to scull, laying her partly on her side so that he would have more control. 'Now,' the girl said. 'We are in our home and I love you. Please kiss me and put all love into it.' The Colonel held her close, with her head thrown back and kissed her until there was nothing left of the kiss but desperation. 'I love you.' 'Whatever that means,' she interrupted. 'I love you and I know whatever that means. The picture is lovely. But there is no word for what you are.' 'Wild,' she said. 'Or careless or unkempt?' 'No.' 'The last was one of the first words I learned from my governess. It means you do not comb your hair enough. Neglectful is when you do not brush one hundred strokes at night.' 'I'm going to run my hand through it and make it unkempter still.' 'Your hurt hand?' 'Yes.' 'We're sitting on the wrong sides for that. Change over.' 'Good. That is a sensible order couched in simple language and easily understood.' It was fun moving over, trying not to disturb the balance of the gondola, but having to trim again carefully. 'Now,' she said. 'But hold me tightly with the other arm.' 'You know just what you want?' 'I do indeed. Is it un-maidenly? I learned that word, too, from my governess.' 'No,' he said. 'It's lovely. Pull up the blanket good and feel that wind.' 'It's from the high mountains.' 'Yes. And beyond there it's from somewhere else.' The Colonel heard the slap of the waves and he felt the wind come sharply and the rough familiarity of the blanket and then he felt the girl cold-warm and lovely and with upraised breasts that his left hand coasted lightly over. Then he ran his bad hand through her hair once, twice and three times and then he kissed her and it was worse than desperation. 'Please,' she said, from almost underneath the blanket. 'Let me kiss now.' 'No,' he said. 'Me again.' The wind was very cold and lashed their faces but under the blanket there was no wind nor nothing; only his ruined hand that searched for the island in the great river with the high steep banks. 'That's it,' she said. He kissed her then and he searched for the island, finding it and losing it and then finding it for good. For good and for bad, he thought and for good and for all. 'My darling,' he said. 'My well beloved. Please.' 'No. Just hold me very tight and hold the high ground, too.' The Colonel said nothing, because he was assisting, or had made an act of presence, at the only mystery that he believed in except the occasional bravery of man. 'Please don't move,' the girl said. 'Then move a great amount.' The Colonel, lying under the blanket in the wind, knowing it is only what man does for woman that he retains; except what he does for his fatherland or his motherland, however you get the reading, proceeded. 'Please, darling,' the girl said. 'I don't think I can stand it.' 'Don't think of anything. Don't think of anything at all.' 'I'm not.' 'Don't think.' 'Oh please let's not talk.' 'Is it right?' 'You know.' 'You're sure.' 'Oh please not talk. Please.' Yes, he thought. Please and please again. She said nothing and neither did he, and when the great bird had flown far out of the closed window of the gondola and was lost and gone, neither of them said anything. He held her head lightly with his good arm and the other arm held the high ground now. 'Please put it where it should be,' she said. 'Your hand.' 'Should we?' 'No. Just hold me tight and try to love me true.' 'I love you true,' he said and just then the gondola turned to the left, quite sharply and the wind was on his right cheek and he said, with his old eyes catching the outline of the Palace where they turned and noting it, 'You're in the lee now, Daughter.' 'But it is too soon now. Don't you know how a woman feels?' 'No. Only what you tell me.' 'Thank you for the you. But don't you really know?' 'No. I never asked, I guess.' 'Guess now,' she said. 'And please wait until after we have gone under the second bridge.' 'Take a glass of this,' the Colonel said, reaching accurately and well for the champagne bucket with the ice and uncorking the bottle the Gran Maestro had uncorked and then placed a common wine cork in. 'This is good for you, Daughter. It is good for all the ills that all of us have and for all sadness and indecision.' 'I have none of those,' she said, speaking grammatically as her governess had taught her. 'I am just a woman, or a girl, or whatever that is, doing whatever it is she should not do. Let's do it again, please, now I am in the lee.' 'Where is the island now and in what river?' 'You are making the discovery. I am only the unknown country.' 'Not too unknown,' the Colonel said. 'Please don't be rude,' the girl said. 'And please attack gently and with the same attack as before.' 'It's no attack,' the Colonel said. 'It is something else.' 'Whatever it is, whatever it is, while I'm still in the lee.' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'Yes, now if you want, or will accept from kindness.' 'Please, yes.' She talks like a gentle cat, though the poor cats cannot speak, the Colonel thought. But then he stopped thinking and he did not think for a long time. The gondola now was in one of the secondary canals. When it had turned from the Grand Canal, the wind had swung it so the gondoliere had to shift all his weight as ballast and the Colonel and the girl had shifted too, under the blanket, with the wind getting under the edge of the blanket; wildly. They had not spoken for a long time and the Colonel had noted that the gondola had only inches free in passing under the last bridge. 'How are you, Daughter?' 'I'm quite lovely.' 'Do you love me?' 'Please don't ask such silly things.' 'The tide is very high and we only just made that last bridge.' 'I think I know where we are going. I was born here.' 'I've made mistakes in my home town,' the Colonel said. 'Being born there isn't everything.' 'It is very much,' the girl said. 'You know that. Please hold me very tightly so we can be a part of each other for a little while.' 'We can try,' the Colonel said. 'Couldn't I be you?' 'That's awfully complicated. We could try of course.' 'I'm you now,' she said. 'And I just took the city of Paris.' 'Jesus, Daughter,' he said. 'You've got an awful lot of problems on your hands. The next thing, they will parade the twenty-eighth division through.' 'I don't care.' 'I do.' 'Were they not good?' 'Sure. They had fine commanders, too. But they were National Guard and hard luck. What you call a T.S. division. Get your T.S. slip from the chaplain.' 'I understand none of those things.' 'They aren't worth explaining,' the Colonel said. 'Will you tell me some true things about Paris? I love it so much and when I think of you taking it, then, it is as though I were riding in this gondola with Marechal Ney.' 'A no good job,' the Colonel said. 'Anyway, not after he fought all those rear-guard actions coming back from that big Russian town. He used to fight ten, twelve, fifteen times a day. Maybe more. Afterwards, he couldn't recognize people. Please don't get in any gondolas with him.' 'He was always one of my great heroes.' 'Yeah. Mine too. Until Quatre Bras. Maybe it wasn't Quatre Bras. I'm getting rusty. Give it the generic title of Waterloo.' 'Was he bad there?' 'Awful,' the Colonel told her. 'Forget it. Too many rear-guard actions coming back from Moskova.' 'But they called him the bravest of the brave.' 'You can't eat on that. You have to be that, always, and then be the smartest of the smart. Then you need a lot of stuff coming up.' 'Tell me about Paris, please. We should not make more love, I know.' 'I don't know it. Who says it?' 'I say it because I love you.' 'All right. You said it and you love me. So we act on that. The hell with it.' 'Do you think we could once more if it would not hurt you?' 'Hurt me?' the Colonel said. 'When the hell was I ever hurt?' Chapter XIV 'Please don't be bad,' she said, pulling the blanket over them both. 'Please drink a glass of this with me. You know you've been hurt.' 'Exactly,' the Colonel said. 'Let's forget it.' 'All right,' she said. 'I learned that word, or those two words from you. We have forgotten it.' 'Why do you like the hand?' the Colonel asked, placing it where he should. 'Please don't pretend to be stupid and please let's not think of anything, or anything, or anything.' 'I am stupid,' the Colonel said. 'But I won't think of anything or anything nor of nothing nor of his brother, to-morrow.' 'Please be good and kind.' 'I will be. And I will tell you, now, a military secret. Top Secret equals British Most Secret. I love you.' 'That's nice,' she said. 'And you put it nicely.' 'I'm nice,' the Colonel said and checked on the bridge that was coming up and saw there was clearance. 'That's the first thing people notice about me.' 'I always use the wrong words,' the girl said. 'Please just love me. I wish it was me who could love you.' 'You do.' 'Yes, I do,' she said. 'With all my heart.' They were going with the wind now and they were both tired. 'Do you thinkâ€”â€”' 'I don't think,' the girl said. 'Well try and think.' 'I will.' 'Drink a glass of this.' 'Why not? It's very good.' It was. There was still ice in the bucket and the wine was cold and clear. 'Can I stay at the Gritti?' 'No.' 'Why not?' 'It wouldn't be right. For them. Nor you. The hell with me.' 'Then I suppose I should go home.' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'That is the logical supposition.' 'That is an awful way to say a sad thing. Can't we even pretend some things?' 'No. I'll take you home and you sleep good and well and to-morrow we will meet where and when you say.' 'May I call the Gritti?' 'Of course. I'll always be awake. Will you call when you are awake?' 'Yes. But why do you always wake so early?' 'It is a business habit.' 'Oh, I wish you were not in that business and that you were not going to die.' 'So do I,' said the Colonel. 'But I'm getting out of the business.' 'Yes,' she said, sleepily and comfortably. 'Then we go to Rome and get the clothes.' 'And live happily ever after.' 'Please don't,' she said. 'Please, please, don't. You know I made the resolution not to cry.' 'You're crying now,' the Colonel said. 'What the hell have you got to lose on that resolution?' 'Take me home, please.' 'That's what I was doing in the first place,' the Colonel told her. 'Be kind once first.' 'I will,' the Colonel said. After they, or the Colonel, rather, had paid the gondoliere who was unknowing, yet knowing all; solid, sound, respectful and trustworthy; they walked into the Piazzetta and then across the great, cold, wind-swept square that was hard and old under their feet. They walked holding close and hard in their sorrow and their happiness. 'This is the place where the German shot the pigeons,' the girl said. 'We probably killed him,' the Colonel said. 'Or his brother. Maybe we hanged him. I wouldn't know. I'm not in C.I.D.' 'Do you love me still on these water-worn, cold and old stones?' 'Yes. I'd like to spread a bed roll here and prove it.' 'That would be more barbarous than the pigeon shooter.' 'I'm barbarous,' the Colonel said. 'Not always.' 'Thank you for the not always.' 'We turn here.' 'I think I know that. When are they going to tear that damned Cinema Palace down and put up a real cathedral? That's what T5 Jackson wants.' 'When someone brings Saint Mark back another time under a load of pork from Alexandria.' 'That was a Torcello boy.' 'You're a Torcello boy.' 'Yes. I'm a Basso Piave boy and a Grappa boy straight here from Pertica. I'm a Pasubio boy, too, if you know what that means. It was worse just to live there than to fight anywhere else. In the platoon they used to share anyone's gonococci brought from Schio and carried in a match-box. They used to share this just so they could leave because it was intolerable.' 'But you stayed.' 'Sure,' the Colonel said. 'I'm always the last man to leave the party, fiesta I mean, not as in political party. The truly unpopular guest.' 'Should we go?' 'I thought you had made up your mind.' 'I had. But when you said it about unpopular guest it was unmade.' 'Keep it made up.' 'I can hold a decision.' 'I know. You can hold any damn thing. But, Daughter, sometimes you don't just hold. That is for stupids. Sometimes you have to switch fast.' 'I'll switch if you like.' 'No. I think the decision was sound.' 'But won't it be an awfully long time until morning?' 'That all depends on whether one has luck or not.' 'I should sleep well.' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'At your age if you can't sleep they ought to take you out and hang you.' 'Oh please.' 'Sorry,' he said. 'I meant shoot you.' 'We are nearly home and you could be kind now if you wanted.' 'I'm so kind I stink. Let somebody else be kind.' They were in front of the palace now and there it was; the palace. There was nothing to do now but pull the bell cord, or enter with the key. I've been lost in this place, the Colonel thought, and I was never lost in my life. 'Please kiss me good night, kindly.' The Colonel did and loved her so he could not bear it. She opened the door with the key, which was in her bag. Then she was gone and the Colonel was alone, with the worn pavement, the wind, which still held in the north and the shadows from where a light went on. He walked home. Only tourists and lovers take gondolas, he thought. Except to cross the canal in the places where there are no bridges. I ought to go to Harry's, probably, or some damn place. But I think I'll go home. Chapter XV It was really home, if a hotel room can be so described. His pyjamas were laid on the bed. There was a bottle of Valpolicella by the reading light and by the bed a bottle of mineral water, in an ice bucket with a glass beside it on the silver tray. The portrait had been deframed and was placed on two chairs where he could see it from the bed. The Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune lay on the bed beside his three pillows. He used three pillows, as Amaldo knew, and his extra bottle of medicine, not the one that he carried in his pocket, was beside the reading light. The inner doors of the armoire, the mirrored ones, were opened in such a way that he could see the portrait from the side. His scuffed slippers were by the bed. I'll buy it, the Colonel said, to himself, since there was no one else there except the portrait. He opened the Valpolicella which had been uncorked, and then re-corked, carefully, precisely and lovingly and poured himself a glass into the glass which was much better than any hotel should use which was faced with breakage. 'Here's to you, Daughter,' he said. 'You beauty and lovely. Do you know, that, among other things, you smell good always? You smell wonderfully even in a high wind or under a blanket or kissing good night. You know almost no one does and you don't use scent.' She looked at him from the portrait and said nothing. 'The hell with it,' he said. 'I'm not going to talk to a picture.' What do you think went wrong to-night? he thought. Me, I guess. Well I will try to be a good boy to-morrow all day; starting at first light. 'Daughter,' he said, and he was talking to her and not to a picture now. 'Please know I love you and that I wish to be delicate and good. And please stay with me always now.' The picture was the same. The Colonel took out the emeralds from his pocket and looked at them, feeling them slide, cold and yet warm, as they take warmth and as all good stones have warmth, from his bad hand into his good hand. I should have put these in an envelope and locked them up, he thought. But what the â€”â€” security is there better than I can give them? I have to get these back to you fast, Daughter. It was fun, though. And they're not worth more than a quarter of a million. What I would make in four hundred years. Have to check that figure. He put the stones in the pocket of his pyjamas and put a handkerchief over them. Then he buttoned the pocket. The first sound thing you learn, he thought, is to have flaps and buttons on all your pockets. I imagine that I learned it too early. The stones felt good. They were hard and warm against his flat, hard, old and warm chest, and he noted how the wind was blowing, looked at the portrait, poured another glass of Valpolicella and then started to read the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune. I ought to take the pills, he thought. But the hell with the pills. Then he took them just the same and went on reading the New York Herald. He was reading Red Smith and he liked him very much. Chapter XVI The colonel woke before daylight and checked that there was no one sleeping with him. The wind was still blowing hard and he went to the open windows to check the weather. There was no light as yet in the east across the Grand Canal, but his eyes could see how rough the water was. Be a hell of a tide to-day, he thought. Probably flood the square. That's always fun. Except for the pigeons. He went to the bathroom, taking the Herald Tribune and Red Smith with him, as well as a glass of Valpolicella. Damn I'll be glad when the Gran Maestro gets those big fiascos, he thought. This wine gets awfully dreggy at the end. He sat there, with his newspaper, thinking of the things of that day. There would be the telephone call. But it might be very late because she would be sleeping late. The young sleep late, he thought, and the beautiful sleep half again as late. She certainly would not call early and the shops did not open until nine or a little later. Hell, he thought, I have these damned stones. How could anyone do a thing like that? You know how, he said to himself, reading the ads. in the back of the paper. You've put it on the line enough times. It isn't crazy or morbid. She just wanted to put it on the line. It was a good thing it was me, he thought. That is the only good thing about being me, he considered. Well I'm me, God-damn it. For better or for much worse. How would you like to sit on the can as you have sat almost every morning of your damned life with this in your pocket? He was addressing no one, except, perhaps, posterity. How many mornings have you sat in the row with all the others? That's the worst of it. That and shaving. Or you go off to be alone and think or not think and pick a good piece of cover and there are two riflemen there already, or some boy asleep. There's no more privacy in the army than in a professional â€”â€”. I've never been in a professional â€”â€” but I imagine they run it much the same. I could learn to run one, he thought. Then I'd make all my leading â€”â€” characters Ambassadors and the unsuccessful ones could be Corps commanders or command military districts in peace time. Don't be bitter, boy, he said to himself. It's too early in the morning and your duty's not completed yet. What would you do with their wives, he asked himself? Buy them new hats or shoot them, he said. It's all part of the same process. He looked at himself in the mirror, set in the half-closed door. It showed him at a slight angle. It's a deflexion shot, he said to himself and they didn't lead me enough. Boy, he said, you certainly are a beat-up, old looking bastard. Now you have to shave and look at that face while you do it. Then you must get a hair-cut. That's easy in this town. You're a Colonel of Infantry, boy. You can't go around looking like Joan of Arc or General (Breveted) George Armstrong Custer. That beautiful horse-cavalryman. I guess it is fun to be that way and have a loving wife and use sawdust for brains. But it must have seemed like the wrong career to him when they finished up on that hill above the Little Big Horn, with the ponies making the circle around them in all the dust and the sage brush crushed by the hooves of the horses of the other people and nothing left to him for the rest of his life but that old lovely black powder smell and his own people shooting each other and themselves, because they were afraid of what the squaws would do to them. The body was unspeakably mutilated, they used to put in this same paper. And on that hill to know you'd made one real mistake, finally and for good and complete with true handles. Poor horse-cavalryman, he thought. The end of all his dreams. That's one good thing about being an Infantryman. You never have any dreams except bad dreams. Well, he said to himself, we're finished here and pretty soon there will be good light and I can see the portrait. I'll be damned if I'll turn that in. I keep that. Oh Christ, he said, I wonder what she looks like now sleeping. I know how she looks, he said to himself. Wonderful. She sleeps as though she had not gone to sleep. As though she were just resting. I hope she is, he thought. I hope she's resting well. Christ Jesus how I love her and I hope I never do her harm. Chapter XVII When it started to be light, the Colonel saw the portrait. He, very probably, saw it as quickly as any man who was civilized and had to read and sign the forms he did not believe in, could see an object, as soon as it was visible. Yes, he said to himself, I have eyes and they have fairly fast perception still and once they had ambition. I have led my Ruffians where they were well peppered. There are but three of the two hundred and fifty of them left alive and they are for the town's end to beg during life. That's from Shakespeare, he told the portrait. The winner and still the undisputed champion. Someone might take him, in a short bout. But I would rather revere him. Did you ever read King Lear, Daughter? Mr. Gene Tunney did and he was the champion of the world. But I read it too. Soldiers care for Mr. Shakespeare too, though it may seem impossible. You have anything to say in your defence except to put your head back? he asked the portrait. You want some more, Shakespeare? You don't have to defend. You just rest and leave it as it is. It's no good. Your defence and my defence is no damn good. But who could tell you to go out and hang yourself the way we do? Nobody, he said to himself and to the portrait. And certainly not me. He put his good hand down and found that the room waiter had left a second bottle of Valpolicella alongside of where the first had been. If you love a country, the Colonel thought, you might as well admit it. Sure, admit it, boy. I have loved three and lost them thrice. Give a credit. We've re-took two. Retaken, he corrected. And we will retake the other one, General Fat Ass Franco on his shooting stick with the advice of his doctor and tame ducks and a screen of Moorish cavalry when he shoots. Yes, he said softly to the girl who looked at him clearly now in the first and best light. We will retake and they will all be hung upside down outside of filling stations. You have been warned, he added. 'Portrait,' he said, 'why the hell can't you just get into bed with me instead of being eighteen solid stone blocks away. Maybe more. I'm not as sharp now as I was; whenever.' 'Portrait,' he said to the girl and to the portrait and to the girl both; but there wasn't any girl and the portrait was as it was painted. 'Portrait, keep your God-damn chin up so you can break my heart easier.' It certainly was a lovely present, the Colonel thought. 'Can you manoeuvre?' he asked the portrait. 'Good and fast?' Portrait said nothing and the Colonel answered. You know damn well she can. She'd out-manoeuvre you the best day you were ever born and she would stay and fight where you would â€”â€”, discreetly. 'Portrait,' he said. 'Boy or daughter or my one true love or whatever it is; you know what it is, portrait.' The Portrait, as before, did not answer. But the Colonel, who was a General now again, early in the morning at the only time he really knew, and with Valpolicella, knew as absolutely as though he had just read his third Wassermann that there was no â€”â€” in Portrait and he felt shame for having talked to Portrait roughly. 'I'll be the best God-damned boy you ever witnessed to-day. And you can tell your principal that.' Portrait, as was her fashion, was silent. She probably would speak to a horse-cavalryman, the General, for now he had two stars and they grated on his shoulders and showed white in the vague, scuffed red on the plaque in front of his jeep. He never used command cars, nor semi-armoured vehicles complete with sand-bags. 'The hell with you, Portrait,' he said. 'Or get your T.S. slip from the universal chaplain of us all, with combined religions. You ought to be able to eat on that.' 'The hell with you,' the Portrait said, without speaking. 'You low class soldier.' 'Yes,' the Colonel said, for now he was a Colonel again and had relinquished all his former rank. 'I love you, Portrait, very much. But don't get rough with me. I love you very much because you are beautiful. But I love the girl better, a million times better, hear it?' There was no sign that she heard it, so he tired of it. 'You are in a fixed position, Portrait,' he said. 'Without or with any frame. And I am going to manoeuvre.' The portrait was as silent as she had been since the concierge had brought her into the room, and aided and abetted by the second waiter, had shown her to the Colonel and to the girl. The Colonel looked at her and saw she was indefensible, now that the light was good, or almost good. He saw, too, that she was the portrait of his own true love and so he said, 'I am sorry for all the stupidnesses I say. I do not wish ever to be brutal. Maybe we could both sleep a little while, with luck, and then, perhaps, your Mistress would call on the telephone?' Maybe she will even call, he thought. Chapter XVIII The hall porter pushed the Gazzettina under the door and the Colonel had it, noiselessly, almost as soon as it had passed through the slit. He very nearly took it from the hall porter's hand. He did not like the hall porter since he had found him, one day, going through his bag, when he, the Colonel, had re-entered the room after having left it, presumably for some time. He had to come back to the room to get his bottle of medicine, which he had forgotten, and the hall porter was well through his bag. 'I guess you don't say stick them up in this hotel,' the Colonel had said. 'But you're no credit to your town.' There was silence produced and re-produced, by the striped waistcoated man with the Fascist face and the Colonel said, 'Go on, boy, look through the rest of it. I don't carry any military secrets with my toilet articles.' Since then, there was scant friendship between them and the Colonel enjoyed trying to take the morning paper from the striped waistcoated man's hand; noiselessly, and when he heard, or saw it first make a move under the door. 'O.K., you won to-day, jerk,' he said in the best Venetian dialect he could summon at that hour. 'Go hang yourself.' But they don't hang themselves, he thought. They just have to go on putting papers under other people's doors that do not even hate them. It must be quite a difficult trade being an ex-Fascist. Maybe he is not an ex-Fascist, too. How do you know. I can't hate Fascists, he thought. Nor Krauts, either, since unfortunately, I am a soldier. 'Listen, Portrait,' he said. 'Do I have to hate the Krauts because we kill them? Do I have to hate them as soldiers and as human beings? It seems too easy a solution to me.' Well, Portrait. Forget it. Forget it. You're not old enough to know about it. You are two years younger than the girl that you portray and she is younger and older than hell; which is quite an old place. 'Listen, Portrait,' he said and, saying it, knew that now, as long as he lived, he would have someone to talk to at the early hours that he woke. 'As I was saying, Portrait. The hell with that too. That's too old for you too. That is one of the things you can't say no matter how true it is. There are lots of things I can never say to you and maybe that will be good for me. It is about time something was. What do you think would be good for me, Portrait?' 'What's the matter, Portrait?' he asked her. 'You getting hungry? I am.' So he rang the bell for the waiter who would bring breakfast. He knew that now, even though the light was so good that every wave showed on the Grand Canal, lead-coloured and solid heavy with the wind and the tide now high over the landing steps of the Palace directly opposite his room, that there would be no telephone call for several hours. The young sleep good, he thought. They deserve it. 'Why do we have to get old?' he asked the waiter who had come in with his glass-eye and the menu. 'I don't know, my Colonel. I suppose it is a natural process.' 'Yes. I guess I imagine that too. The eggs fried with their faces up. Tea and toast.' 'You don't want anything American?' 'The hell with anything American except me. Is the Gran Maestro astir yet?' 'He has your Valpolicella in the big wicker fiascos of two litres and I have brought this decanter with it.' 'That one,' the Colonel said. 'I wish to Christ I could give him a regiment.' 'I don't think he would want one, really.' 'No,' the Colonel said. 'I don't want one, really, myself.' Chapter XIX The colonel breakfasted with the leisure of a fighter who has been clipped badly, hears four and knows how to relax truly for five seconds more. 'Portrait,' he said. 'You ought to relax too. That's the only thing that is going to be difficult about you. That's what they call the static element in painting. You know, Portrait that almost no pictures, paintings rather, move at all. A few do, but not many. 'I wish that your mistress was here and we could have movement. How do girls like you and she know so much so damn young and be so beautiful? 'With us, if a girl is really beautiful, she comes from Texas and maybe, with luck, she can tell you what month it is. They can all count good though. 'They teach them how to count and keep their legs together and how to put their hair up in pin curls. Sometime, Portrait, for your sins, if you have any, you ought to have to sleep in a bed with a girl who has put her hair up in pin curls to be beautiful to-morrow. Not to-night. They'd never be beautiful to-night. For to-morrow, when we make the competition. 'The girl, Renata, that you are, is sleeping now without ever having done anything to her hair. She is sleeping with it spread out on the pillow and all it is to her is a glorious, dark, silky annoyance, that she can hardly remember to comb, except that her governess taught her. 'I see her in the street with the lovely long-legged stride and the wind doing anything it wants to her hair and her true breasts under the sweater and then I see the nights in Texas with the pin curls; tight and subjected by metallic instruments. 'Pin me no pin curls, my beloved,' he said to the portrait, 'and I will try to lay it on the line in round, heavy, hard silver dollars or with the other.' I mustn't get rough, he thought. Then he said to the portrait, for he did not capitalize her now in his mind, 'You are so God-damned beautiful you stink. Also you are jail-bait. Renata's two years older now. You are under seventeen.' And why can't I have her and love her and cherish her and never be rude, nor bad and have the five sons that go to the five corners of the world; wherever that is! I don't know. I guess the cards we draw are those we get. You wouldn't like to re-deal would you, dealer? No. They only deal to you once and then you pick them up and play them. I can play them, if I draw any damn thing at all, he told portrait; who was also unimpressed. 'Portrait,' he said. 'You better look the other way so that you will not be un-maidenly. I am going to take a shower now and shave, something you will never have to do, and put on my soldier-suit and go and walk around this town even though it is too early.' So, he got out of bed, favouring his bad leg, which hurt him always. He pulled the reading light with his bad hand. There was sufficient light and he had been wasting electricity for nearly an hour. He regretted this as he regretted all his errors. He walked past portrait, only looking casually and looked at himself in the mirror. He had dropped both parts of his pyjamas and he looked at himself critically and truly. 'You beat-up old bastard,' he said to the mirror. Portrait was a thing of the past. Mirror was actuality and of this day. The gut is flat, he said without uttering it. The chest is all right except where it contains the defective muscle. We are hung as we are hung, for better or worse, or something, or something awful. You are one half a hundred years old, you bastard you. Now go in and take a shower and scrub good and afterwards put on your soldier-suit. To-day is another day. Chapter XX The colonel stopped at the reception desk in the lobby, but the concierge was not there yet. There was only the night porter. 'Can you put something in the safe for me?' 'No, my Colonel. No one may open the safe until the assistant manager, or the concierge, arrives. But I will guard anything for you that you wish.' 'Thank you. It's not worth the trouble,' and he buttoned the Gritti envelope, with the stones inside, the envelope addressed to himself, into the inside left pocket of his tunic. 'There's no real crime here now,' the night porter said. It had been a long night and he was happy to speak to someone. 'There never really was, my Colonel. There are only differences of opinion and politics.' 'What do you have for politics?' the Colonel asked; for he was lonely, too. 'About what you would expect.' 'I see. And how is your thing going?' 'I think it goes quite well. Maybe not as well as last year. But still quite well. We were beaten and we have to wait a while now.' 'Do you work at it?' 'Not much. It is more the politics of my heart than of my head. I believe in it with my head too, but I have very little political development.' 'When you get it you won't have any heart.' 'Maybe not. Do you have politics in the army?' 'Plenty,' the Colonel said. 'But not what you mean.' 'Well, we better not discuss it then. I have not meant to be intrusive.' 'I asked the question; the original question rather. It was only to talk. It was not an interrogation.' 'I don't think it was. You do not have the face of an inquisitor, my Colonel, and I know about the Order, although I am not a member.' 'You may be member material. I'll take it up with the Gran Maestro.' 'We come from the same town; but from distinct quarters.' 'It's a good town.' 'My Colonel, I have so little political development that I believe all honourable men are honourable.' 'Oh you'll get over that,' the Colonel assured him. 'Don't worry, boy. You've got a young party. Naturally you make errors.' 'Please don't talk like that.' 'It was just rough early morning joking.' 'Tell me, my Colonel, what do you really think about Tito?' 'I think several things. But he's my next-door neighbour. I've found it better not to talk about my neighbour.' 'I'd like to learn.' 'Then learn it the hard way. Don't you know people don't give answers to such questions?' 'I had hoped they did.' 'They don't,' the Colonel said. 'Not in my position. All I can tell you is that Mr. Tito has plenty problems.' 'Well, I know that now truly,' the night porter who was really only a boy said. 'I hope you do,' the Colonel said. 'I wouldn't call it, as knowledge, any pearl of great price. Now, good day, for I must take a walk for the good of my liver, or something.' 'Good day, my Colonel. Fa brutto tempo.' Chapter XXI The colonel took the ten centesimi gondola across the Canal, paying the usual dirty note and standing with the crowd of those condemned to early rising. He looked back at the Gritti and saw the windows of his room; still open. There was no promise, nor threat of rain; only the same strong, wild, cold wind from the mountains. Everyone in the gondola looked cold and the Colonel thought, I wish I could issue these wind-proof coats to everyone on board. God, and every officer that ever wore one, knows they are not water-proof and who made the money out of that one? You can't get water through a Burberry. But I suppose some able jerk has his boy in Groton now, or maybe Canterbury, where the big contractors' boys go, because our coats leaked. And what about some brother officer of mine who split with him? I wonder who the Benny Meyers of the ground forces were? There probably wasn't only one. Probably, he thought, there must be very many. You must not be awake yet, to talk that simply. They do keep the wind out though. The raincoats. Raincoats my ass. The gondola pulled up between the stakes on the far bank of the canal and the Colonel watched the black-clad people climb up out of the black-painted vehicle. Is she a vehicle? he thought. Or must a vehicle have wheels or be tracked? Nobody would give you a penny for your thoughts, he thought. Not this morning. But I've seen them worth a certain amount of money when the chips were down. He penetrated into the far side of the city, the side that finally fronted on the Adriatic and that he liked the best. He was going in by a very narrow street and he was going to not keep track of the number of more or less north and south streets that he crossed, nor count the bridges and then try and orient himself so he would come out at the market without getting up any dead ends. It was a game you play, as some people used to play double Canfield or any solitary card games. But it had the advantage of you moving while you do it and that you look at the houses, the minor vistas, the shops and the trattorias and at old palaces of the city of Venice while you are walking. If you loved the city of Venice it was an excellent game. It is a sort of solitaire ambulante and what you win is the happiness of your eye and heart. If you made the market, on this side of town, without ever being stymied, you won the game. But you must not make it too easy and you must not count. On the other side of the town, game was to leave from the Gritti and make the Rialto by the Fondamente Nuove without a mistake. Then you could climb the bridge and cross it and go down into the market. He liked the market best. It was the part of any town he always went to first. Just then he heard the two young men behind him saying the things about him. He knew they were young men by their voices and he did not look back, but listened carefully for distance and waited for the next turn to see them, as he turned. They are on their way to work, he decided. Maybe they are former Fascists or maybe they are something else, or maybe it is just the line that they are talking. But they are making it pretty personal now. It isn't just Americans, it is also me, myself, my grey hair, the slightly crooked way I walk, the combat boots (those, of that stripe, disliked the practicability of combat boots. They liked boots that rang on the flag stones and took a high black polish). It is my uniform which they find to be without grace. Now it is why I am walking at this hour and now it is their absolute security that I can no longer make love. The Colonel swung sharp to the left at the next corner, seeing what he had to deal with and the exact distance and when the two young men came around the corner which was formed by the apse of the church of Frari there was no Colonel. He was in the dead angle behind the apse of the ancient church and as they passed, he, hearing them come by their talk, stepped out with a hand in each low pocket of his raincoat and turned himself and the raincoat, with the two hands in the pockets, towards them. They stopped and he looked at them both in the face and smiled his old and worn death smile. Then he looked down at their feet, as you always look at the feet of such people, since they wear their shoes too tight and when you take the shoes off them you see their hammer-toes. The Colonel spat on the pavement and said nothing. The two of them, they were the first thing he had suspected, looked at him with hatred and with that other thing. Then they were off like marsh-birds, walking with the long strides of herons too, the Colonel thought, and something of the flight of curlews and looking back with hatred, waiting to have the last word if the distance was ever safe. It is a pity they weren't ten against one, the Colonel thought. They might have fought. I should not blame them, since they were defeated. But their manners were not good in respect to a man of my rank and age. Also it was not intelligent to think all fifty-year-old colonels would not understand their language. Nor was it intelligent to think old Infantrymen would not fight this early in the morning against the simple odds of two to one. I'd hate to fight in this town where I love the people. I would avoid it. But couldn't those badly educated youths realize what sort of animal they were dealing with? Don't they know how you get to walk that way? Nor any of the other signs that combat people show as surely as a fisherman's hands tell you if he is a fisherman from the creases from the cord cuts. It is true they only saw my back and ass and legs and boots. But you'd think they might have told from the way they must move. Maybe they don't any more. But when I had a chance to look at them and think. Take the two of them out and hang them, I believe they understood. They understood quite clearly. What's a man's life worth anyway? Ten thousand dollars if his insurance is paid up in our army. What the hell has that got to do with it. Oh yes, that was what I was thinking about before those jerks showed; how much money I had saved my government, in my time when people like Benny Meyers were in the trough. Yes, he said and how much you lost them at the Chateau that time at ten Gs a head. Well nobody ever really understood it except me, I guess. There's no reason to tell them now. Your commanding general sometimes puts things down as the Fortunes of War. Back at Army they know such things are bound to happen. You do it, as ordered, with a big butcher bill and you're a hero. Christ, I am opposed to the excessive butcher bill, he thought. But you get the orders, and you have to carry them out. It is the mistakes that are no good to sleep with. But why the hell sleep with them anyway. It never did any good. But they can certainly crawl into a sack sometimes. They can crawl in and stay in there with you. Cheer up, boy, he said. Remember you had a lot of money on you when you picked that one. And you might have been stripped if you lost. You can't fight a lick any more with your hands and you didn't have any weapon. So don't be gloomy, boy, or man, or Colonel, or busted General. We're almost to the market now and you made it without hardly noticing. Hardly noticing is bad, he added. Chapter XXII He loved the market. A great part of it was close-packed and crowded into several side streets and it was so concentrated that it was difficult not to jostle people, unintentionally, and each time you stopped to look, to buy, or to admire, you formed an Ã®lot de rÃ©sistance against the flow of the morning attack of the purchasers. The Colonel liked to study the spread and high piled cheeses and the great sausages. People at home think mortadella is a sausage, he thought. Then he said to the woman in the booth, 'Let me try a little of that sausage, please. Only a sliver.' She cut a thin, paper thin, slice for him, ferociously and lovingly, and when the Colonel tasted it there was the half smoky, black pepper-corned, true flavour of the meat from the hogs that ate acorns in the mountains. 'I will take a quarter of a kilo.' The Barone's lunches for the shooting blinds were of a Spartan quality, which the Colonel respected, since he knew no one should eat much while shooting. He felt, though, that he might augment the lunch with his sausage and share it with the poler and picker-upper. He might give a slice to Bobby, the retriever, who would be wet through to his hide many times and enthusiastic still, but shaking with cold. 'Is this the best sausage that you have?' he asked the woman. 'Have you nothing that does not show and is reserved for better and steadier customers?' 'This is the best sausage. There are many other sausages, as you know. But this is the best.' 'Then give me one-eighth of a kilo of a sausage that is highly fortifying, but is not highly seasoned.' 'I have it,' she said. 'It is a little new but exactly as you describe.' This sausage was for Bobby. But you do not say that you buy sausages for a dog in Italy where the worst crime is to be considered a fool and many people go hungry. You may give expensive sausage to a dog before a man who works for his living and knows what a dog goes through in water in cold weather. But you do not buy them, stating your purpose in possessing them, unless you are a fool, or a millionaire from the war and from after. The Colonel paid for the wrapped-up package and proceeded on through the market inhaling the smell of roasted coffee and looking at the amount of fat on each carcass in the butcher section, as though he were enjoying the Dutch painters, whose names no one remembers, who painted, in perfection of detail, all things you shot, or that were eatable. A market is the closest thing to a good museum like the Prado or as the Accademia is now, the Colonel thought. He took a short cut and was at the fish market. In the market, spread on the slippery stone floor, or in their baskets, or their rope-handled boxes, were the heavy, grey-green lobsters with their magenta overtones that presaged their death in boiling water. They have all been captured by treachery, the Colonel thought, and their claws are pegged. There were the small soles and there were a few albacore and bonito. These last, the Colonel thought, looked like boat-tailed bullets, dignified in death and with the huge eye of the pelagic fish. They were not made to be caught except for their voraciousness. The poor sole exists, in shallow water, to feed man. But these other roving bullets, in their great bands, live in blue water and travel through all oceans and all seas. A nickel for your thoughts now, he thought. Let's see what else they have. There were many eels, alive and no longer confident in their eeldom. There were fine prawns that could make a scampi brochetto spitted and broiled on a rapier-like instrument that could be used as a Brooklyn ice-pick. There were medium-sized shrimps, grey and opalescent, awaiting their turn, too, for the boiling water and their immortality, to have their shucked carcasses float out easily on an ebb tide on the Grand Canal. The speedy shrimp, the Colonel thought, with tentacles longer than the moustaches of that old Japanese admiral, comes here now to die for our benefit. Oh Christian shrimp, he thought, master of retreat, and with your wonderful intelligence service in those two light whips, why did they not teach you about nets and that lights are dangerous? Must have been some slip-up, he thought. Now he looked at the many small crustaceans, the razor-edge clams you only should eat raw if you had your typhoid shots up to date, and all the small delectables. He went past these, stopping to ask one seller where his clams came from. They came from a good place, without sewerage, and the Colonel asked to have six opened. He drank the juice and cut the clam out, cutting close against the shell with the curved knife the man handed him. The man had handed him the knife because he knew from experience the Colonel cut closer to the shell than he had been taught to cut. The Colonel paid him the pittance that they cost, which must have been much greater than the pittance those received who caught them, and he thought, now I must see the stream and canal fishes and get back to the hotel. Chapter XXIII The colonel arrived at the lobby of the Hotel Gritti-Palace. His gondolieres were paid off and, now, inside the hotel, there was no wind. It had taken two men to bring the gondola up the Grand Canal from the market. They had both worked hard, and he had paid them what it was worth, and some more. 'Are there any calls for me?' he asked the concierge, who was now in attendance. The concierge was light, fast, sharp-faced, intelligent and polite, always, without subservience. He wore the crossed keys of his office on the lapels of his blue uniform without ostentation. He was the concierge. It is a rank very close to that of Captain, the Colonel thought. An officer and not a Gentleman. Make it top sergeant in the old days; except he's dealing always with the brass. 'My lady has called twice,' the concierge said in English. Or whatever that language should be called we all speak, the Colonel thought. Leave it at English. That is about what they have left. They should be allowed to keep the name of the language. Cripps will probably ration it shortly, anyway. 'Please put me through to her at once,' he told the concierge. The concierge commenced to dial numbers. 'You may talk over there, my Colonel,' he said. 'I have made the connection.' 'You're fast.' 'Over there,' the concierge said. Inside the booth the Colonel lifted the receiver and said, automatically, 'Colonel Cantwell speaking.' 'I called twice, Richard,' the girl said. 'But they explained that you were out. Where were you?' 'At the market. How are you, my lovely?' 'No one listens on this phone at this hour. I am your lovely. Whoever that is.' 'You. Did you sleep well?' 'It was like ski-ing in the dark. Not really ski-ing but really dark.' 'That's the way it should be. Why did you wake so early? You've frightened my concierge.' 'If it is not un-maidenly, how soon can we meet, and where?' 'Where you wish and when you wish.' 'Do you still have the stones and did Miss Portrait help any?' 'Yes to both questions. The stones are in my upper left-hand pocket and buttoned down. Miss Portrait and I talked late and early and it made everything much easier.' 'Do you love her more than me?' 'I'm not abnormal yet. Perhaps that's bragging. But she's lovely.' 'Where should we meet?' 'Should we have breakfast at the Florian, on the right-hand side of the square? The square should be flooded and it will be fun to watch.' 'I'll be there in twenty minutes if you want me.' 'I want you,' the Colonel said and hung up. Coming out of the telephone booth he, suddenly, did not feel good and then he felt as though the devil had him in an iron cage, built like an iron lung or an iron maiden, and he walked, grey-faced, to the concierge's desk and said, in Italian, 'Domenico, Ico, could you get me a glass of water, please?' The concierge was gone and he leaned on the desk resting. He rested lightly and without illusion. Then the concierge was back with the glass of water, and he took four tablets of the type that you take two, and he continued resting as lightly as a hawk rests. 'Domenico,' he said. 'Yes.' 'I have something here in an envelope that you can put in the safe. It may be called for either by myself, in person, or in writing, or by the person you have just put that call through to. Would you like that in writing?' 'No. It would be unnecessary.' 'But what about you, boy? You're not immortal, are you?' 'Fairly so,' the concierge told him. 'But I will put it in writing, and after me, comes the Manager and the Assistant Manager.' 'Both good men,' the Colonel agreed. 'Wouldn't you like to sit down, my Colonel?' 'No. Who sits down except men and women in change of life hotels? Do you sit down?' 'No.' 'I can rest on my feet, or against a God-damned tree. My countrymen sit down, or lie down, or fall down. Give them a few energy crackers to stall their whimpers.' He was talking too much to regain confidence quickly. 'Do they really have energy crackers?' 'Sure. It has something in it that keeps you from getting excited. It's like the atomic bomb, only played backwards.' 'I can't believe it.' 'We have the most terrific military secrets that one General's wife ever told another. Energy crackers is the least of it. Next time we will give all Venice botulism from 56,000 feet. There's nothing to it,' the Colonel explained. 'They give you anthrax, and you give them botulism.' 'But it will be horrible.' 'It will be worse than that,' the Colonel assured him. 'This isn't classified. It's all been published. And while it goes on you can hear Margaret, if you tune in right, singing the Star Spangled Banner on the radio. I think that could be arranged. The voice I would not describe as a big one. Not as we know voices who have heard the good ones in our time. But everything is a trick now. The radio can almost make the voice. And the Star Spangled Banner is fool-proof until towards the last.' 'Do you think they will drop anything here?' 'No. They never have.' The Colonel, who was four star general now, in his wrath and in his agony and in his need for confidence, but secured temporarily through the absorption of the tablets, said, 'Ciao, Domenico,' and left the Gritti. He figured it took twelve and one half minutes to reach the place where his true love would probably arrive a little late. He walked it carefully and at the speed he should walk it. The bridges were all the same. Chapter XXIV His true love was at the table at the exact time that she said she would be. She was as beautiful as always In the hard, morning light that came across the flooded square, and she said, 'Please, Richard. Are you all right? Please?' 'Sure,' the Colonel said. 'You wonder beauty.' 'Did you go to all our places in the market?' 'Only a few of them. I did not go where they have the wild ducks.' 'Thank you.' 'For nothing,' the Colonel said. 'I never go there when we are not together.' 'Don't you think I should go to the shoot?' 'No. I am quite sure. Alvarito would have asked you if he wanted you.' 'He might not have asked me because he wanted me.' 'That's true,' the Colonel said, and pondered that for two seconds. 'What do you want for breakfast?' 'Breakfast is worthless here, and I don't like the square when it is flooded. It is sad and the pigeons have no place to alight. It is only really fun towards the last when the children play. Should we go and have breakfast at the Gritti?' 'Do you want to?' 'Yes.' 'Good. We'll have breakfast there. I've had mine already.' 'Really?' 'I'll have some coffee and hot rolls, and only feel them with my fingers. Are you awfully hungry?' 'Awfully,' she said, truly. 'We'll give breakfast the full treatment,' the Colonel said. 'You'll wish you had never heard of breakfast.' As they walked, with the wind at their back, and her hair blowing better than any banner, she asked him, holding close, 'Do you still love me in the cold, hard Venice light of morning? It is really cold and hard, isn't it?' 'I love you and it is cold and hard.' 'I loved you all night when I was ski-ing in the dark.' 'How do you do that?' 'It is the same runs except that it is dark and the snow is dark instead of light. You ski the same; controlled and good.' 'Did you ski all night? That would be many runs.' 'No. Afterwards I slept soundly and well and I woke happy. You were with me and you were asleep like a baby.' 'I wasn't with you and I was not asleep.' 'You're with me now,' she said and held close and tight. 'And we are almost there.' 'Yes.' 'Have I told you, yet, properly, that I love you?' 'You told me. But tell me again.' 'I love you,' he said. 'Take it frontally and formally please.' 'I take it anyway you want as long as it is true.' 'That's the proper attitude,' he said. 'You good, brave, lovely girl. Turn your hair sideways once on top of this bridge and let it blow obliquely.' He had made a concession, with obliquely, instead of saying, correctly, oblique. 'That's easy,' she said. 'Do you like it?' He looked and saw the profile and the wonder early morning colour and her chest upstanding in the black sweater and her eyes in the wind and he said, 'Yes, I like it.' 'I'm very glad,' she said. Chapter XXV At the Gritti, the Gran Maestro seated them at the table which was beside the window that looked out on the Grand Canal. There was no one else in the dining-room. The Gran Maestro was festive and well with the morning. He took his ulcers day by day, and his heart the same way. When they did not hurt he did not hurt either. 'Your pitted compatriot eats in bed at his hotel, my colleague tells me,' he confided to the Colonel. 'We may have a few Belgians. "The bravest of these were the Belgians,"' he quoted. 'There is a pair of pescecani from you know where. But they are exhausted and I believe they will eat, as pigs, in their room.' 'An excellent situation report,' the Colonel said. 'Our problem, Gran Maestro, is that I have already eaten in my room as pitted does and as the pescecani will. But this ladyâ€”â€”' 'Young girl,' interrupted the Gran Maestro with his whole-face smile. He was feeling very good since it was a completely new day. 'This very young lady wants a breakfast to end breakfasts.' 'I understand,' the Gran Maestro said, and he looked at Renata and his heart rolled over as a porpoise does in the sea. It is a beautiful movement and only a few people in this world can feel it and accomplish it. 'What do you want to eat, Daughter?' the Colonel asked, looking at her early morning, un-retouched dark beauty. 'Everything.' 'Would you give any suggestions?' 'Tea instead of coffee and whatever the Gran Maestro can salvage.' 'It won't be salvage, Daughter,' said the Gran Maestro. 'I'm the one who calls her Daughter.' 'I said it honestly,' the Gran Maestro said. 'We can make or fabricar rognons grilled with champignons dug by people I know. Or, raised in damp cellars. There can be an omelet with truffles dug by pigs of distinction. There can be real Canadian bacon from maybe Canada, even.' 'Wherever that is,' the girl said happily and unillusioned. 'Wherever that is,' said the Colonel seriously. 'And I know damn well where it is.' 'I think we should stop the jokes now and get to the breakfast.' 'If it is not un-maidenly I think so too.' 'Mine is a decanted flask of the Valpolicella.' 'Nothing else?' 'Bring me one ration of the alleged Canadian bacon,' the Colonel said. He looked at the girl, since they were alone now, and he said, 'How are you, my dearest?' 'Quite hungry, I suppose. But thank you for being good for so long a time.' 'It was easy,' the Colonel told her in Italian. Chapter XXVI They sat there at the table and watched the early stormy light over the Canal. The grey had turned to a yellow-grey now, with the sun, and the waves were working against the outgoing tide. 'Mummy says she can't live here too long at any time because there are no trees,' the girl said. 'That's why she goes to the country.' 'That's why everyone goes to the country,' the Colonel said. 'We could plant a few trees if we found a place with a big enough garden.' 'I like Lombardy poplars and plane trees the best, but I am still quite uneducated.' 'I like them, and cypresses and chestnut trees. The real chestnut and the horse-chestnut. But you will never see trees, Daughter, until we go to America. Wait till you see a white pine or a ponderosa pine.' 'Will we see them when we make the long trip and stop at all the filling stations or comfort stations or whatever they are called?' 'Lodges and Tourist Camps,' the Colonel said. 'Those others we stop at; but not for the night.' 'I want so much for us to roll up to a comfort station and plank down my money and tell them to fill her up and check the oil, Mac, the way it is in American books or in the films.' 'That's a filling station.' 'Then what is a comfort station?' 'Where you go, you knowâ€”â€”' 'Oh,' the girl said and blushed. 'I'm sorry.' 'I want to learn American so much. But I suppose I shall say barbarous things the way you do sometimes in Italian.' 'It is an easy language. The further West you go the straighter and the easier it becomes.' The Gran Maestro brought the breakfast and the odour of it, although it did not spread through the room, due to the silver covers on the dishes, came to them steady and as broiled bacon and kidneys, with the dark lustreless smell of grilled mushrooms added. 'It looks lovely,' the girl said. 'Thank you very much, Gran Maestro. Should I talk American?' she asked the Colonel. She extended her hand to the Gran Maestro lightly, and fastly, so that it darted as a rapier does, and said, 'Put it there, Pal. This grub is tops.' The Gran Maestro said, 'Thank you, my lady.' 'Should I have said chow instead of grub?' the girl asked the Colonel. 'They are really interchangeable.' 'Did they talk like that out West when you were a boy? What would you say at breakfast?' 'Breakfast was served, or offered up, by the cook. He would say, "Come and get it, you sons of bitches, or I'll throw it away."' 'I must learn that for in the country. Sometimes when we have the British Ambassador and his dull wife for dinner I will teach the footman, who will announce dinner, to say, "Come and get it, you sons of bitches, or we will throw it away."' 'He'd devaluate,' the Colonel said. 'At any rate, it would be an interesting experiment.' 'Tell me something I can say in true American to the pitted one if he comes in. I will just whisper it in his ear as though I were making a rendezvous, as they did in the old days.' 'It would depend on how he looks. If he is very dejected looking, you might whisper to him, "Listen, Mac. You hired out to be tough, didn't you?"' 'That's lovely,' she said, and repeated it in a voice she had learned from Ida Lupino. 'Can I say it to the Gran Maestro?' 'Sure. Why not. Gran Maestro!' The Gran Maestro came over and leaned forward attentively. 'Listen, Mac. You hired out to be tough, didn't you?' the girl hard-worded him. 'I did indeed,' the Gran Maestro said. 'Thank you for stating it so exactly.' 'If that one comes in and you wish to speak to him after he has eaten, just whisper in his ear, "Wipe the egg off your chin, Jack, and straighten up and fly right."' 'I'll remember it and I'll practise it at home.' 'What are we going to do after breakfast?' 'Should we go up and look at the picture and see if it is of any value; I mean any good; in the daylight?' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. Chapter XXVII Upstairs the room was already done and the Colonel, who had anticipated a possible messiness of locale, was pleased. 'Stand by it once,' he said. Then remembered to add, 'Please.' She stood by it, and he looked at it from where he had looked at it last night. 'There's no comparison, of course,' he said. 'I don't mean likeness. The likeness is excellent.' 'Was there supposed to be a comparison?' the girl asked, and swung her head back and stood there with the black sweater of the portrait. 'Of course not. But last night, and at first light, I talked to the portrait as though it were you.' 'That was nice of you and shows it has served some useful purpose.' They were lying now on the bed and the girl said to him, 'Don't you ever close windows?' 'No. Do you?' 'Only when it rains.' 'How much alike are we?' 'I don't know. We never had much of a chance to find out.' 'We've never had a fair chance. But we've had enough of a chance for me to know.' 'And when you know what the hell have you got?' the Colonel asked. 'I don't know. Something better than there is, I suppose.' 'Sure. We ought to try for that. I don't believe in limited objectives. Sometimes you're forced to, though.' 'What is your great sorrow?' 'Other people's orders,' he said. 'What's yours?' 'You.' 'I don't want to be a sorrow. I've been a sorry son of a bitch many times. But I never was anybody's sorrow.' 'Well you are mine now.' 'All right,' he said. 'We'll take it that way.' 'You're nice to take it that way. You're very kind this morning. I'm so ashamed about how things are. Please hold me very close and let's not talk, or think, about how things might have been different.' 'Daughter, that's one of the few things I know how to do.' 'You know many, many things. Don't say such a thing.' 'Sure,' the Colonel said. 'I know how to fight forwards and how to fight backwards and what else?' 'About pictures and about books and about life.' 'That's easy. You just look at the pictures without prejudice, and you read the books with as open a mind as you have, and you live life.' 'Don't take off your tunic, please.' 'All right.' 'You do anything when I say please.' 'I have done things without.' 'Not very often.' 'No,' the Colonel agreed. 'Please is a pretty word.' 'Please, please, please.' 'Per Piacere. It means for pleasure. I wish we always talked Italian.' 'We could in the dark. Although there are things that say better in English. 'I love you my last true and only love,' she quoted. 'When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed. And out of the cradle endlessly rocking. And come and get it, you sons of bitches, or I'll throw it away. You don't want those in other languages, do you, Richard?' 'No.' 'Kiss me again, please.' 'Unnecessary please.' 'I would probably end up as an unnecessary please myself. That is the good thing about you going to die that you can't leave me.' 'That's a little rough,' the Colonel said. 'Watch your beautiful mouth a little on that.' 'I get rough when you get rough,' she said. 'You wouldn't want me to be completely otherwise?' 'I would not want you to be in any way other than you are and I love you truly, finally and for good.' 'You say nice things very clearly sometimes. What was it happened with you and your wife, if I may ask?' 'She was an ambitious woman and I was away too much.' 'You mean she went away, from ambition, when you only were away from duty?' 'Sure,' the Colonel said and remembered, as unbitterly as he could. 'She had more ambition than Napoleon and about the talent of the average High School Valedictorian.' 'Whatever that is,' the girl said. 'But let's not speak about her. I'm sorry I asked the question. She must be sad that she is not with you.' 'No. She is too conceited ever to be sad, and she married me to advance herself in Army circles, and have better contacts for what she considered her profession, or her art. She was a journalist.' 'But they are dreadful,' the girl said. 'I agree.' 'But you couldn't have married a woman journalist that kept on being that?' 'I told you I made mistakes,' the Colonel said. 'Let's talk about something nice.' 'Let's.' 'But that was terrible. How could you have done such a thing?' 'I don't know. I could tell you in detail but let's skip it.' 'Please let's skip it. But I had no idea it was something as awful as that. You wouldn't do such a thing now, would you?' 'I promise you, my sweet.' 'But you don't ever write to her?' 'Of course not.' 'You wouldn't tell her about us, so she could write about it?' 'No. I told her about things once, and she wrote about them. But that was in another country and besides the wench is dead.' 'Is she really dead?' 'Deader than Phoebus the Phoenician. But she doesn't know it yet.' 'What would you do if we were together in the Piazza and you saw her?' 'I'd look straight through her to show her how dead she was.' 'Thank you very much,' the girl said. 'You know that another woman, or a woman in memory, is a terrible thing for a young girl to deal with when she is still without experience.' 'There isn't any other woman,' the Colonel told her, and his eyes were bad and remembering. 'Nor is there any woman of memory.' 'Thank you, very much,' the girl said. 'When I look at you I believe it truly. But please never look at me nor think of me like that.' 'Should we hunt her down and hang her to a high tree?' the Colonel said with anticipation. 'No. Let us forget her.' 'She is forgotten,' the Colonel said. And, strangely enough, she was. It was strange because she had been present in the room for a moment, and she had very nearly caused a panic; which is one of the strangest things there is, the Colonel thought. He knew about panics. But she was gone now, for good and for ever; cauterized; exorcized and with the eleven copies of her re-classification papers, in which was included the formal, notarized act of divorcement, in triplicate. 'She is forgotten,' the Colonel said. It was quite true. 'I'm so pleased,' the girl said. 'I don't know why they ever let her into the hotel.' 'We're enough alike,' the Colonel said. 'We better not carry it too God-damned far.' 'You can hang her if you wish because she is why we cannot marry.' 'She's forgotten,' the Colonel told her. 'Maybe she will take a good look at herself in the mirror sometime and hang herself.' 'Now that she is out of the room we should wish her no bad luck. But, as a good Venetian, I wish that she were dead.' 'So do I,' the Colonel said. 'And now, since she is not, let us forget her for keeps.' 'For keeps and for always,' the girl said. 'I hope that is the correct diction. Or in Spanish para sempre.' 'Para sempre and his brother,' the Colonel said. Chapter XXVIII They lay together now and did not speak and the Colonel felt her heart beat. It is easy to feel a heart beat under a black sweater knitted by someone in the family, and her dark hair lay, long and heavy, over his good arm. It isn't heavy, he thought, it is lighter than anything there is. She lay, quiet and loving, and whatever it was that they possessed was in complete communication. He kissed her on the mouth, gently and hungrily, and then it was as though there was static, suddenly, when communications had been perfect. 'Richard,' she said. 'I'm sorry about things.' 'Never be sorry,' the Colonel said. 'Never discuss casualties, Daughter.' 'Say it again.' 'Daughter.' 'Will you tell me some happy things I can have for during the week and some more of war for my education?' 'Let's skip war.' 'No. I need it for my education.' 'I do too,' the Colonel said. 'Not manoeuvres. You know, in our army once, a general officer through chicanery obtained the plan of the manoeuvre. He anticipated every move of the enemy force and comported himself so brilliantly that he was promoted over many better men. And that was why we got smacked one time. That and the prevalence of week-ends.' 'We're on a week-end now.' 'I know,' the Colonel said. 'I can still count up to seven.' 'But are you bitter about everything?' 'No. It is just that I am half a hundred years old and I know things.' 'Tell me something more about Paris because I love to think of you and Paris in the week.' 'Daughter, why don't you lay off Paris?' 'But I've been in Paris, and I will go back there again, and I want to know. It is the loveliest city in the world, next to our own, and I want to know some things truly to take with me.' 'We will go together and I will tell you there.' 'Thank you. But tell me a little now for this week only.' 'Leclerc was a high-born jerk as I think that I've explained. Very brave, very arrogant and extremely ambitious. He is dead, as I said.' 'Yes, you told me.' 'They say you should never speak ill of the dead. But I think it is the best time to speak truly of them. I have never said anything of a dead that I would not say to his face,' and he added, 'in spades.' 'Let's not talk about him. I have re-classified him in my mind.' 'What do you want then; picturesque?' 'Yes please. I have bad taste from reading the illustrated papers. But I will read Dante all week while you are gone. I'll go to mass each morning. That should be enough.' 'Go to Harry's before lunch too.' 'I will,' she said. 'Please tell me some picturesque.' 'Don't you think we might better just go to sleep?' 'How can we go to sleep now when we have so little time? Feel this,' she said and pushed her whole head up under his chin until she forced his head back. 'All right, I'll talk.' 'Give me your hand first to hold. I'll have it in my hand when I read the Dante and do the other things.' 'Dante was an execrable character. More conceited than Leclerc.' 'I know. But he did not write execrably.' 'No. Leclerc could fight too. Excellently.' 'Now tell me.' Her head was on his chest now, and the Colonel said, 'Why did you not want me to take off the tunic?' 'I like to feel the buttons. Is it wrong?' 'I'll be a sad son of a bitch,' the Colonel said. 'How many people fought in your family?' 'Everybody,' she said. 'Always. They were traders as well and several of them were Doges of this city as you know.' 'But they all fought?' 'All,' she said. 'As far as I know.' 'O.K.,' the Colonel said. 'I'll tell you any God-damn thing you want to know.' 'Just something picturesque. As bad or worse than in the illustrated papers.' 'Domenica Del Corriere or Tribuna Illustrata?' 'Worse, if possible.' 'Kiss me first.' She kissed him kind, and hard, and desperately, and the Colonel could not think about any fights or any picturesque or strange incidents. He only thought of her and how she felt and how close life comes to death when there is ecstasy. And what the hell is ecstasy and what's ecstasy's rank and serial number? And how does her black sweater feel? And who made all her smoothness and delight and the strange pride and sacrifice and wisdom of a child? Yes, ecstasy is what you might have had and instead you draw sleep's other brother. Death is a lot of â€”â€”, he thought. It comes to you in small fragments that hardly show where it has entered. It comes, sometimes, atrociously. It can come from unboiled water; an un-pulled-up mosquito boot, or it can come with the great, white-hot, clanging roar we have lived with. It comes in small cracking whispers that precede the noise of the automatic weapon. It can come with the smoke-emitting arc of the grenade, or the sharp, cracking drop of the mortar. I have seen it come, loosening itself from the bomb rack, and falling with that strange curve. It comes in the metallic rending crash of a vehicle, or the simple lack of traction on a slippery road. It comes in bed to most people, I know, like love's opposite number. I have lived with it nearly all my life and the dispensing of it has been my trade. But what can I tell this girl now on this cold, windy morning in the Gritti Palace Hotel? 'What would you like to know, Daughter?' he asked her. 'Everything.' 'All right,' the Colonel said. 'Here goes.' Chapter XXIX They lay on the pleasantly hard, new-made bed with their legs pressed tight against one another, and her head was on his chest, and her hair spread across his old hard neck; and he told her. 'We landed without much opposition. They had the true opposition at the other beach. Then we had to link up with the people who had been dropped, and take and secure various towns, and then we took Cherbourg. This was difficult, and had to be done very fast, and the orders were from a General called Lightning Joe that you never would have heard of. Good General.' 'Go on, please. You spoke about Lightning Joe before.' 'After Cherbourg we had everything. I took nothing but an admiral's compass because I had a small boat at that time on Chesapeake Bay. But we had all the Wehrmacht stamped Martell and some people had as much as six million German-printed French francs. They were good until a year ago, and at that time they were worth fifty to the dollar, and many a man has a tractor now instead of simply one mule who knew how to send them home through his Esses, or sometimes his Gs. 'I never stole anything except the compass because I thought it was bad luck to steal, unnecessarily, in war. But I drank the cognac and I used to try to figure out the different corrections on the compass when I had time. The compass was the only friend I had, and the telephone was my life. We had more wire strung than there are â€”â€” in Texas.' 'Please keep telling me and be as little rough as you can. I don't know what the word means and I don't want to know.' 'Texas is a big state,' the Colonel said. 'That is why I used it and its female population as a symbol. You cannot say more â€”â€” than Wyoming because there are less than thirty thousand there, perhaps, hell, make it fifty, and there was a lot of wire, and you kept stringing it and rolling it up, and stringing it again.' 'Go on.' 'We will cut to the break-through,' the Colonel said. 'Please tell me if this bores you.' 'No.' 'So we made the mucking break-through,' the Colonel said, and now his head was turned to her head, and he was not lecturing; he was confessing. 'The first day most of them came over and dropped the Christmas tree ornaments that confuse the other people's radar and it was called off. We were ready to go but they called it off. Quite properly I am sure. I love the very high brass like I love the pig's you know.' 'Tell it to me and don't be bad.' 'Conditions were not propitious,' the Colonel said. 'So the second day we were for it, as our British cousins, who could not fight their way out of a wet tissue towel, say, and over came the people of the wild, blue yonder. 'They were still taking off from the fields where they lived on that green-grassed aircraft carrier that they called England, when we saw the first of them. 'Shining, bright and beautiful, because they had scraped the invasion paint by then, or maybe they had not. My memory is not exact about this part. 'Anyway, Daughter, you could see the line of them going back towards the east further than you could see. It was like a great train. They were high in the sky and never more beautiful. I told my S-2 that we should call them the Valhalla Express. Are you tired of it?' 'No. I can see the Valhalla Express. We never saw it in such numbers. But we saw it. Many times.' 'We were back two thousand yards from where we were to take off from. You know what two thousand yards is, Daughter, in a war when you are attacking?' 'No. How could I?' 'Then the front part of the Valhalla Express dropped coloured smoke and turned and went home. This smoke was dropped accurately, and clearly showed the target which was the Kraut positions. They were good positions and it might have been impossible to move him out of them without something mighty and picturesque such as we were experiencing. 'Then, Daughter, the next sections of the Valhalla Express dropped everything in the world on the Krauts and where they lived and worked to hold us up. Later it looked as though all of the earth had erupted and the prisoners that we took shook as a man shakes when his malaria hits him. They were very brave boys from the Sixth Parachute Division and they all shook and could not control it though they tried. 'So you can see it was a good bombing. Just the thing we always need in this life. Make them tremble in the fear of justice and of might. 'So then, Daughter, not to bore you, the wind was from the east and the smoke began to blow back in our direction. The heavies were bombing on the smoke line and the smoke line was now over us. Therefore they bombed us the same as they had bombed the Krauts. First it was the heavies, and no one need ever worry about hell who was there that day. Then, to really make the break-through good and to leave as few people as possible on either side, the mediums came over and bombed who was left. Then we made the break-through as soon as the Valhalla Express had gone home, stretching in its beauty and its majesty from that part of France to all over England.' If a man has a conscience, the Colonel thought, he might think about air-power some time. 'Give me a glass of that Valpolicella,' the Colonel said, and remembered to add, 'please.' 'Excuse me,' he said. 'Be comfortable, honey dog, please. You asked me to tell you.' 'I'm not your honey dog. That must be someone else.' 'Correct. You're my last and true and only love. Is that correct? But you asked me to tell you.' 'Please tell me,' the girl said. 'I'd like to be your honey dog if I knew how to do it. But I am only a girl from this town that loves you.' 'We'll operate on that,' the Colonel said. 'And I love you. I probably picked up that phrase in the Philippines.' 'Probably,' the girl said. 'But I would rather be your straight girl.' 'You are,' the Colonel said. 'Complete with handles and with the flag on top.' 'Please don't be rough,' she said. 'Please love me true and tell me as true as you can, without hurting yourself in any way.' 'I'll tell you true,' he said. 'As true as I can tell and let it hurt who it hurts. It is better that you hear it from me if you have curiosity on this subject, than that you read it in some book with stiff covers.' 'Please don't be rough. Just tell me true and hold me tight and tell me true until you are purged of it; if that can be.' 'I don't need to purge,' he said. 'Except heavies being used tactically. I have nothing against them if they use them right even if they kill you. But for ground support give me a man like Pete Quesada. There is a man who will boot them in.' 'Please.' 'If you ever want to quit a beat-up character like me that guy could give you ground support.' 'You are not beat-up, whatever that is, and I love you.' 'Please give me two tablets from that bottle and pour the glass of Valpolicella that you neglected to pour, and I will tell you some of the rest of it.' 'You don't have to. You don't have to tell me and I know now it is not good for you. Especially not the Valhalla Express day. I am not an inquisitor; or whatever the female of inquisitor is. Let us just lie quietly and look out of the window, and watch and see what happens on our Grand Canal.' 'Maybe we better. Who gives a damn about the war anyway?' 'You and me, maybe,' she said and stroked his head. 'Here are the two things from the square bottle. Here is the glass of decanted vino. I'll send you better from our own estates. Please let us sleep a little while. Please be a good boy and we just lie together and love each other. Please put your hand here.' 'My good or my bad?' 'Your bad,' the girl said. 'The one I love and must think about all week. I cannot keep it like you keep the stones.' 'They're in the safe,' the Colonel said. 'In your name,' he added. 'Let's just sleep and not talk about any material things nor any sorrows.' 'The hell with sorrows,' the Colonel said with his eyes closed and his head resting lightly on the black sweater that was his fatherland. You have to have some damned fatherland, he thought. Here is mine. 'Why aren't you President?' the girl asked. 'You could be an excellent president.' 'Me president? I served in the Montana National Guard when I was sixteen. But I never wore a bow tie in my life and I am not, nor ever have been, an unsuccessful haberdasher. I have none of the qualifications for the Presidency. I couldn't even head the opposition even though I don't have to sit on telephone books to have my picture taken. Nor am I a no-fight general. Hell, I never even was at SHAEF. I couldn't even be an elder statesman. I'm not old enough. Now we are governed in some way, by the dregs. We are governed by what you find in the bottom of dead beer glasses that whores have dunked their cigarettes in. The place has not even been swept out yet and they have an amateur pianist beating on the box.' 'I don't understand it because my American is so incomplete. But it sounds awful. But don't be angry about it. Let me be angry for you.' 'Do you know what an unsuccessful haberdasher is?' 'No.' 'It is not discreditable. There are many of them in our country. There is at least one in every town. No, Daughter, I am only a fighting soldier and that is the lowest thing on earth. In that you run for Arlington, if they return the body. The family has a choice.' 'Is Arlington nice?' 'I don't know,' the Colonel said. 'I was never buried there.' 'Where would you like to be buried?' 'Up in the hills,' he said, making a quick decision. 'On any part of the high ground where we beat them.' 'I suppose you should be buried on the Grappa.' 'On the dead angle of any shell-pocked slope if they would graze cattle over me in the summer time.' 'Do they have cattle there?' 'Sure. They always have cattle where there is good grass in the summer, and the girls of the highest houses, the strong built ones, the houses and the girls, that resist the snow in winter, trap foxes in the fall after they bring the cattle down. They feed from pole-stacked hay.' 'And you don't want Arlington or PÃ¨re Lachaise or what we have here?' 'Your miserable boneyard.' 'I know it is the most unworthy thing about the town. The city rather. I learned to call cities towns from you. But I will see that you go where you wish to go and I will go with you if you like.' 'I would not like. That is the one thing we do alone. Like going to the bathroom.' 'Please do not be rough.' 'I meant that I would love to have you with me. But it is very egotistical and an ugly process.' He stopped, and thought truly, but off-key, and said, 'No. You get married and have five sons and call them all Richard.' 'The lion-hearted,' the girl said, accepting the situation without even a glance, and playing what there was she held as you put down all the cards, having counted exactly. 'The louse-hearted,' the Colonel said. 'The unjust bitter criticizer who speaks badly of everyone.' 'Please don't be rough in talking,' the girl said. 'And remember you speak worst of all about yourself. But hold me as close as we can and let's think about nothing.' He held her as close as he could and he tried to think about nothing. Chapter XXX The colonel and the girl lay quietly on the bed and the Colonel tried to think of nothing; as he had thought of nothing so many times in so many places. But it was no good now. It would not work any more because it was too late. They were not Othello and Desdemona, thank God, although it was the same town and the girl was certainly better looking than the Shakespearean character, and the Colonel had fought as many, or more times than the garrulous Moor. They are excellent soldiers, he thought. The damned Moors. But how many of them have we killed in my time? I think we killed more than a generation if you count the final Moroccan campaign against Abdel Krim. And each one you have to kill separately. Nobody ever killed them in mass, as we killed Krauts before they discovered Einheit. 'Daughter,' he said. 'Do you want me to really tell you, so you will know, if I am not rough telling it?' 'I would rather have you tell me than anything. Then we can share it.' 'It cuts pretty thin for sharing,' the Colonel said. 'It's all yours, Daughter. And it's only the high-lights. You wouldn't understand the campaigns in detail, and few others would. Rommel might. But they always had him under wraps in France and, besides, we had destroyed his communications. The two tactical air-forces had; ours and the R.A.F. But I wish I could talk over certain things with him. I'd like to talk with him and with Ernst Udet.' 'Just tell me what you wish and take this glass of Valpolicella and stop if it makes you feel badly. Or don't tell it at all.' 'I was a spare-parts Colonel at the start,' the Colonel explained carefully. 'They are hang-around Colonels, which are given to a Division Commander to replace one that he may have killed, or that is relieved. Almost none are killed; but many are relieved. All the good ones are promoted. Fairly fast when the thing starts to move sort of like a forest fire.' 'Go on, please. Should you take your medicine?' 'The hell with my medicine,' the Colonel said. 'And the hell with SHAEF.' 'You explained that to me,' the girl said. 'I wish the hell you were a soldier with your straight true brain and your beauty memory.' 'I would wish to be a soldier if I could fight under you.' 'Never fight under me,' the Colonel said. 'I'm cagey. But I'm not lucky. Napoleon wanted them lucky and he was right.' 'We've had some luck.' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'Good and bad.' 'But it was all luck.' 'Sure,' the Colonel said. 'But you can't fight on luck. It is just something that you need. The people who fought on luck are all gloriously dead like Napoleon's horse cavalry.' 'Why do you hate cavalry? Almost all the good boys I know were in the three good regiments of cavalry, or in the navy.' 'I don't hate anything, Daughter,' the Colonel said, and drank a little of the light, dry, red wine which was as friendly as the house of your brother, if you and your brother are good friends. 'I only have a point of view, arrived at after careful consideration, and an estimate of their capabilities.' 'Are they not really good?' 'They are worthless,' the Colonel said. Then remembering to be kind, added, 'In our time.' 'Every day is a disillusion.' 'No. Every day is a new and fine illusion. But you can cut out everything phoney about the illusion as though you would cut it with a straight-edge razor.' 'Please never cut me.' 'You're not cut-able.' 'Would you kiss me and hold me tight, and we both look at the Grand Canal where the light is lovely now, and you tell me more?' When they were looking out at the Grand Canal where the light was, indeed, lovely, the Colonel went on, 'I got a regiment because the Commanding General relieved a boy that I had known since he was eighteen years old. He was not a boy any more, of course. It was too much regiment for him and it was all the regiment I ever could have hoped for in this life until I lost it.' He added, 'Under orders, of course.' 'How do you lose a regiment?' 'When you are working around to get up on the high ground and all you would have to do is send in a flag, and they would talk it over and come out if you were right. The professionals are very intelligent and these Krauts were all professionals; not the fanatics. The phone rings and somebody calls from Corps who has his orders from Army or maybe Army Group or maybe even SHAEF, because they read the name of the town in a newspaper, possibly sent in from Spa, by a correspondent, and the order is to take it by assault. It's important because it got into the newspapers. You have to take it. 'So you leave one company dead along a draw. You lose one company complete and you destroy three others. The tanks get smacked even as fast as they could move and they could move fast both ways. 'They hit them one, two, three, four, five. 'Three men usually get out of the five (that are inside) and they run like broken-field runners that have been shaken loose in a play when you are in Minnesota and the others are Beloit, Wisconsin. 'Do I bore you?' 'No. I do not understand the local allusions. But you can explain them when you care to. Please keep on telling me.' 'You get into the town, and some handsome jerk puts an air mission on you. This mission might have been ordered and never cancelled. Let's give everyone the benefit of the doubt. I'm just telling you about things in a general way. It is better not to be specific and a civilian wouldn't understand it. Not even you. 'This air mission does not help much, Daughter. Because maybe you cannot stay in the town because you have got too few people in, and by now, you are digging them out of rubble; or leaving them in rubble. There are two schools of thought on that. So they say to take it by assault. They repeat this. 'This has been rigidly confirmed by some politician in uniform who has never killed in his life, except with his mouth over the telephone, or on paper, nor ever has been hit. Figure him as our next President if you want him. Figure him any way you like. But figure him and his people, the whole great business establishment, so far back that the best way to communicate with them rapidly would be by racing carrier pigeons. Except, with the amount of security they maintained for their proper persons, they would probably have their anti-aircraft shoot the pigeons down. If they could hit them. 'So you do it again. Then I will tell you what it looks like.' The Colonel looked up at the play of the light on the ceiling. It was reflected, in part, from the Canal. It made strange, but steady movements, changing, as the current of a trout stream changes, but remaining, still changing as the sun moved. Then he looked at his great beauty, with her strange, dark, grown-up child's face that broke his heart, that he would be leaving before 1335 (that was sure) and he said, 'Let's not talk about the war, Daughter.' 'Please,' she said. 'Please. Then I will have it all this week.' 'That's a short sentence. I mean using the word sentence as a jail sentence.' 'You don't know how long a week can be when you are nineteen.' 'Several times I have known how long an hour can be,' the Colonel said. 'I could tell you how long two minutes and a half can be.' 'Please tell me.' 'Well, I had two days' leave in Paris between the Schnee-Eifel fight and this one, and due to my friendship with one or two people I was privileged to be present at some sort of a meeting, where only the accredited and trusted were present, and General Walter Bedell Smith explained to all of us how easy the operation that later took the name of Hurtgen Forest would be. It was not really Hurtgen Forest. That was only a small sector. It was the Stadtswald and it was where the German High Command had figured, exactly, to fight after Aachen had been taken and the road into Germany breached. I hope I am not boring you.' 'You never bore me. Nothing about fighting bores me except lies.' 'You're a strange girl.' 'Yes,' she said. 'I've known that for quite a long time.' 'Would you really like to fight?' 'I don't know if I could do it. But I could try if you taught me.' 'I'll never teach you. I'll just tell you anecdotes.' 'Sad stories of the death of kings.' 'No. GIs somebody christened them. God how I hate that word and how it was used. Comic book readers. All from some certain place. Most of them there unwillingly. Not all. But they all read a paper called "The Stars and Stripes" and you had to get your unit into it, or you were unsuccessful as a commander. I was mostly unsuccessful. I tried to like the correspondents and there were some very good ones present at this meeting. I will not name names because I might omit some fine ones and that would be unjust. There were good ones that I don't remember. Then, there were draft dodgers, phonies who claimed that they were wounded if a piece of spent metal ever touched them, people who wore the purple heart from jeep accidents, insiders, cowards, liars, thieves and telephone racers. There were a few deads missing from this briefing. They had deads too. A big percentage. But none of the deads were present as I said. They had women at it though in wonderful uniforms.' 'But how did you ever marry one?' 'By mistake as I explained before.' 'Go on and tell me.' 'There were more maps in the room than Our Lord could read on his best day,' the Colonel continued. 'There were the Big Picture, the Semi-Big Picture and the Super-Big-Picture. All these people pretended to understand them, as did the boys with the pointers, a sort of half-arsed billiard cue that they used for explanation.' 'Don't say rough words. I don't know, even, what half-arsed means.' 'Shortened, or abbreviated in an inefficient manner,' the Colonel explained. 'Or deficient as an instrument, or in character. It's an old word. You could probably find it in Sanscrit.' 'Please tell me.' 'What for? Why should I perpetuate ignominy just with my mouth?' 'I'll write it if you want. I can write truly what I hear or think. I would make mistakes of course.' 'You are a lucky girl if you can write truly what you hear or think. But don't you ever write one word of this.' He resumed, 'The place is full of correspondents dressed according to their taste. Some are cynical and some are extremely eager. 'To ride herd on them, and to wield the pointers, there is a group of pistol-slappers. We call a pistol-slapper a non-fighting man, disguised in uniform, or you might even call it costume, who gets excited every time the weapon slaps against his thighs. Incidentally, Daughter, the weapon, not the old pistol, the real pistol, has missed more people in combat than probably any weapon in the world. Don't ever let anyone give you one unless you want to hit people on the head with it in Harry's Bar.' 'I never wanted to hit anyone; except perhaps Andrea.' 'If you ever hit Andrea, hit him with the barrel; not with the butt. The butt is awfully slow, and it misses and if it lands you get blood on your hands when you put the gun away. Also please do not ever hit Andrea because he is my friend. I do not think he would be easy to hit either.' 'No. I do not think so either. Please tell me some more about the meeting, or the assembly. I think I could recognize a pistol-slapper now. But I would like to be checked out more thoroughly.' 'Well, the pistol-slappers, in all the pride of their pistol-slappery, were awaiting the arrival of the great General who was to explain the operation. 'The correspondents were muttering, or twittering, and the intelligent ones were glum or passively cheerful. Everybody sat on folding chairs as for a Chautauqua lecture. I'm sorry about these local terms; but we are a local people. 'In comes the General. He is no pistol-slapper, but a big business man; an excellent politician, the executive type. The Army is the biggest business, at that moment, in the world. He takes the half-assed pointer, and he shows us, with complete conviction, and without forebodings, exactly what the attack will be, why we are making it, and how facilely it will succeed. There is no problem.' 'Go on,' the girl said. 'Please let me fill your glass and you, please look at the light on the ceiling.' 'Fill it and I'll look at the light and I will go on. 'This high pressure salesman, and I say this with no disrespect, but with admiration for all his talents, or his talent, also told what we would have of the necessary. There would be no lack of anything. The organization called SHAEF was then based on a town named Versailles outside of Paris. We would attack to the east of Aachen a distance of some 380 kilometres from where they were based. 'An army can get to be huge; but you can close up a little bit. They finally went as far forward as Rheims which was 240 kilometres from the fighting. That was many months later. 'I understand the necessity of the big executive being removed from contact with his working people. I understand about the size of the army and the various problems. I even understand logistics which is not difficult. But no one ever commanded from that far back in history.' 'Tell me about the town.' 'I'll tell you,' the Colonel said. 'But I don't want to hurt you.' 'You never hurt me. We are an old town and we had fighting men, always. We respect them more than all others and I hope we understand them a little. We also know they are difficult. Usually, as people, they are very boring to women.' 'Do I bore you?' 'What do you think?' the girl asked. 'I bore myself, Daughter.' 'I don't think you do, Richard, you would not have done something all your life if you were bored by it. Don't lie to me, please, darling, when we have so little time. 'I won't.' 'Don't you see you need to tell me things to purge your bitterness?' 'I know I tell them to you.' 'Don't you know I want you to die with the grace of a happy death? Oh, I'm getting all mixed up. Don't let me get too mixed up.' 'I won't, Daughter.' 'Tell me some more, please, and be just as bitter as you want.' Chapter XXXI 'Listen, Daughter,' the Colonel said. 'Now we will cut out all references to glamour and to high brass, even from Kansas, where the brass grows higher than osage-orange trees along your own road. It bears a fruit you can't eat and it is purely Kansan. Nobody but Kansans ever had anything to do with it; except maybe us who fought. We ate them every day. Osage oranges,' he added. 'Only we called them K Rations. They weren't bad. C Rations were bad. Ten in ones were good. 'So we fought. It is dull but it is informative. This is the way it goes if anyone is ever interested; which I doubt. 'It goes like this: 1300 Red S-3: White jumped off in time. Red said they were waiting to tie in behind White. 1305 (that is one o'clock and five minutes after in the afternoon, if you can remember that, Daughter) Blue S-3, you know what an S-3 is, I hope, says, "Let us know when you move." Red said they were waiting to tie in behind White. 'You can see how easy it is,' the Colonel told the girl. 'Everybody ought to do it before breakfast.' 'We cannot all be combat infantrymen,' the girl told him softly. 'I respect it more than anything except good, honest fliers. Please talk, I'm taking care of you.' 'Good fliers are very good and should be respected as such,' the Colonel said. He looked up at the light on the ceiling and he was completely desperate at the remembrance of his loss of his battalions, and of individual people. He could never hope to have such a regiment, ever. He had not built it. He had inherited it. But, for a time, it had been his great joy. Now every second man in it was dead and the others nearly all were wounded. In the belly, the head, the feet or the hands, the neck, the back, the lucky buttocks, the unfortunate chest and the other places. Tree burst wounds hit men where they would never be wounded in open country. And all the wounded were wounded for life. 'It was a good regiment,' he said. 'You might even say it was a beautiful regiment until I destroyed it under other people's orders.' 'But why do you have to obey them when you know better?' 'In our army you obey like a dog,' the Colonel explained. 'You always hope you have a good master.' 'What kind of masters do you get?' 'I've only had two good ones so for. After I reached a certain level of command, many nice people, but only two good masters.' 'Is that why you are not a General now? I would love it if you were a General.' 'I'd love it too,' the Colonel said. 'But maybe not with the same intensity.' 'Would you try to sleep, please, to please me?' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'You see, I thought that if you slept you might get rid of them, just being asleep.' 'Yes. Thank you very much,' he said. There was nothing to it, gentlemen. All a man need ever do is obey. Chapter XXXII 'You slept quite well for a time,' the girl told him, lovingly and gently. 'Is there anything you would like me to do?' 'Nothing,' the Colonel said. 'Thank you.' Then he turned bad and he said, 'Daughter, I could sleep good straight up and down in the electric chair with my pants slit and my hair clipped. I sleep as, and when, I need it.' 'I can never be like that,' the girl said, sleepily. 'I sleep when I am sleepy.' 'You're lovely,' the Colonel told her. 'And you sleep better than anyone ever slept.' 'I am not proud of it,' the girl said, very sleepily. 'It is just something that I do.' 'Do it, please.' 'No. Tell me very low and soft and put your bad hand in mine.' 'The hell with my bad hand,' the Colonel said. 'Since when was it so bad?' 'It's bad,' the girl said. 'Badder, or worse, than you will ever know. Please tell me about combat without being too brutal.' 'An easy assignment,' the Colonel said. 'I'll skip the times. The weather is cloudy and the place is 986342. What's the situation? We are smoking the enemy with artillery and mortar. S-3 advises that S-6 wants Red to button up by 1700. S-6 wants you to button up and use plenty of artillery. White reports that they are in fair shape. S-6 informs that A company will swing around and tie in with B. 'B Company was stopped first by enemy action and stayed there of their own accord. S-6 isn't doing so good. This is unofficial. He wants more artillery but there isn't any more artillery. 'You wanted combat for what? I don't know really why. Or really know why. Who wants true combat? But here it is, Daughter, on the telephone and later I will put in the sounds and smells and anecdotes about who was killed when and where if you want them.' 'I only want what you will tell me.' 'I'll tell you how it was,' the Colonel said, 'and General Walter Bedell Smith doesn't know how it was yet. Though, probably, I am wrong, as I have been so many times.' 'I'm glad we don't have to know him or the nylon-smooth man,' the girl said. 'We won't have to know them this side of hell,' the Colonel assured her. 'And I will have a detail guarding the gates of hell so that no such characters enter.' 'You sound like Dante,' she said sleepily. 'I am Mister Dante,' he said. 'For the moment.' And for a while he was and he drew all the circles. They were as unjust as Dante's but he drew them. Chapter XXXIII 'I will skip the detailed part since you are, justifiably, and should be, sleepy,' the Colonel said. He watched, again, the strange play of the light on the ceiling. Then he looked at the girl, who was more beautiful than any girl that he had ever seen, ever. He had seen them come and go, and they go faster, when they go, than any other thing that flies. They can go faster from fair beauty to the knocker's shop than any other animal, he thought. But I believe that this one could hold the pace and stay the course. The dark ones last the best, he thought, and looked at the bony structure in that face. This one has a fine blood line too, and she can go for ever. Most of our own lovely beauties come from soda counters, and they do not know their grandfather's last name, unless, maybe, it was Schultz. Or Schlitz, he thought. This is the wrong attitude to take, he said to himself; since he did not wish to express any of these sentiments to the girl, who would not like them anyway, and was soundly sleepy now the way a cat is when it sleeps within itself. 'Sleep well, my dearest lovely, and I will just tell it for nothing.' The girl was asleep, still holding his bad hand, that he despised, and he could feel her breathe, as the young breathe when they are easily asleep. The Colonel told her all about it; but he did not utter it. So after I had the privilege of hearing General Walter Bedell Smith explain the facility of the attack, we made it. There was the Big Red One, who believed their own publicity. There was the Ninth, which was a better Division than we were. There was us, who had always done it when they asked for you to do it. We had no time to read comic books, and we had no time for practically nothing, because we always moved before first light. This is difficult and you have to throw away the Big Picture and be a division. We wore a four-leaf clover, which meant nothing except among ourselves, who all loved it. And every time I ever see it the same thing happens in my inner guts. Some people thought that it was ivy. But it was not. It was a four-leaf clover disguised as ivy. The orders were that we would attack with the Big Red One, the First Infantry Division of the Army of the United States, and they, and their Calypso singing PRO never let you forget it. He was a nice guy. And it was his job. But you get fed up with horse-dung unless you like the aroma or the taste. I never liked it. Although I loved to walk through cow-dung when I was a kid and feel it between my toes. But horse-dung bores you. It bores me very rapidly, and I can detect it at over one thousand yards. So we attacked, the three of us in line, exactly where the Germans wished us to attack. We will not mention General Walter Bedell Smith any further. He is not the villain. He only made the promises and explained how it would go. There are no villains, I presume, in a Democracy. He was only just as wrong as hell. Period, he added in his mind. The patches had all been removed even as far back as the rear echelon so that no Kraut would know that it was us, the three he knew so well, who were going to attack. We were going to attack with the three of us in line and nothing in reserve. I won't try to explain what that means, Daughter. But it isn't any good. And the place we were going to fight in, which I had taken a good look at, was going to be Passchendaele with tree bursts. I say that too much. But I think it too much. The poor bloody twenty-eighth which was up on our right had been bogged down for some time and so there was pretty accurate information available about what conditions in those woods were going to be like. I think we could conservatively describe them as unfavourable. Then we were ordered to commit one regiment before the attack started. That means that the enemy will get at least one prisoner which makes all the taking off of the Divisional patches silly. They would be waiting for the old four-leaf clover people who would go straight to hell like a mule and do it for one hundred and five days. Figures of course mean nothing to civilians. Nor to the characters from SHAEF we never saw in those woods. Incidentally, and of course these occurrences are always incidental at the SHAEF level, the regiment was destroyed. It was no one's bloody fault, especially not the fault of the man who commanded it. He was a man I would be glad to spend half my time in hell with; and may yet. It certainly would be odd if instead of going to hell, as we always counted on, we should go to one of those Kraut joints like Valhalla and not be able to get along with the people. But maybe we could get a corner table with Rommel and Udet and it would be just like any winter-sports hotel. It will probably be hell though and I don't even believe in hell. Well anyway this regiment was rebuilt as American regiments always are by the replacement system. I won't describe it since you can always read about it in a book by somebody who was a replacement. It boils down, or distils, to the fact you stay in until you are hit badly or killed or go crazy and get section-eighted. But I guess it is logical and as good as any other, given the difficulties of transport. However it leaves a core of certain un-killed characters who know what the score is and no one of these characters liked the look of these woods much. You could sum up their attitude In this phrase, 'Don't â€”â€” me, Jack.' And since I had been an un-killed character for around twenty-eight years I could understand their attitude. But they were soldiers, so most of them got killed in those woods and when we took the three towns that looked so innocent and were really fortresses. They were just built to tempt us and we had no word on them at all. To continue to use the silly parlance of my trade: this could or could not be faulty intelligence. 'I feel terribly about the regiment,' the girl said. She had wakened and spoken straight from sleep. 'Yes,' said the Colonel. 'So do I. Let's drink to it once. Then you go to sleep, Daughter, please. The war is over and forgotten.' Please don't think that I am conceited, Daughter, he said, without speaking. His true love was sleeping again. She slept in a different way than his career girl had slept. He did not like to remember how the career girl slept, yet he did. But he wanted to forget it. She did not sleep pretty, he thought. Not like this girl who slept as though she were awake and alive; except she was asleep. Please sleep well, he thought. Who the hell are you to criticize career girls? he thought. What miserable career did you attempt and have failed at? I wished to be, and was, a General Officer in the Army of the United States. I have failed and I speak badly of all who have succeeded. Then his contrition did not last, and he said to himself, 'Except the brown-nosers, the five and ten and twenty percenters and all the jerks from wherever who never fought and hold commands.' They killed several men from the Academy at Gettysburg. That was the big kill day of all kill days, when there was a certain amount of opposition by both sides. Don't be bitter. They killed General McNair by mistake the day the Valhalla Express came over. Quit being bitter. People from the Academy were killed and there are statistics to prove it. How can I remember if I am not bitter? Be as bitter as you want. And tell the girl, now silently, and that will not hurt her, ever, because she is sleeping so lovely. He said lovely to himself since his thinking was often un-grammatical. Chapter XXXIV Sleep softly, my true love, and when you wake, this will be over and I will joke you out of trying to learn details of the triste metier of war and we will go to buy the little negro, or moor, carved in ebony with his fine features and his jewelled turban. Then you will pin him on and we will go to have a drink at Harry's and see whoever or whatever of our friends that will be afoot at that hour. We will lunch at Harry's, or we'll come back here and I will be packed. We will say good-bye and I will get into the motoscafo with Jackson and make some cheerful crack to the Gran Maestro and wave to any other members of the Order and ten to one, the way I feel right now, or two will get you thirty, we will not ever see one another again. Hell, he said to no one and certainly not aloud, I've felt this way before many fights and almost always at some time in the fall of the year and always when leaving Paris. Probably it doesn't mean a thing. Who gives a damn anyway except me and the Gran Maestro and this girl; I mean at command level. I give very much of a damn myself. But I certainly should be trained and adjusted by this time not to give a much for nothing; like the definition of a whore. A woman who does not, etc. But we won't think about that boy, lieutenant, captain, major, colonel, general, sir. We will just lay it on the line once more and the hell with it and with its ugly face that old Hieronymus Bosch really painted. But you can sheathe your scythe, old brother death, if you have got a sheath for it. Or, he added, thinking of Hurtgen now, you can take your scythe and stick it. It was Passchendaele with tree bursts, he told nobody except the wonder light on the ceiling. Then he looked at the girl, to see that she was sleeping well enough so even his thoughts would not hurt her. Then he looked at the portrait and he thought, I have her in two positions, lying down, turned a little on her side and looking at me straight in front. I'm a lucky son of a bitch and I should never be sad about anything. Chapter XXXV The first day there, we lost the three battalion commanders. One killed in the first twenty minutes and the other two hit later. This is only a statistic to a journalist. But good battalion commanders have never yet grown on trees; not even Christmas trees which was the basic tree of that woods. I do not know how many times we lost company commanders how many times over. But I could look it up. They aren't made, nor grown, as fast as a crop of potatoes is either. We got a certain amount of replacements but I can remember thinking that it would be simpler and more effective, to shoot them in the area where they de-trucked, than to have to try to bring them back from where they would be killed and bury them. It takes men to bring them back and gasoline and men to bury them. These men might just as well be fighting and get killed too. There was snow, or something, rain or fog, all the times and the roads had been mined as many as fourteen mines deep in certain stretches, so when the vehicles churned down to a new string deeper, in another part of the mud, you were always losing vehicles and, of course, the people that went with them. Besides just mortaring it all to hell and having all the fire-lanes taped for machine-gun and automatic weapon fire, they had the whole thing worked out and canalized so however you out-thought them you ran right into it. They also shelled you with heavy artillery fire and with at least one railway gun. It was a place where it was extremely difficult for a man to stay alive even if all he did was be there. And we were attacking all the time and every day. Let's not think about it. The hell with it. Maybe two things I will think about and get rid of them. One was a bare-assed piece of hill that you had to cross to get into Grosshau. Just before you had to make this run, which was under observation with fires by 88s, there was a little piece of dead ground where they could only hit you with a howitzer, only interdicting fires, or, from the right by mortar. When we cleaned it up we found they had good observation for their mortars there too. This was a comparatively safe place, I'm really not lying, not me nor anybody eke. You can't fool those that were in Hurtgen and if you lied they would know it the minute you opened your mouth, Colonel or no Colonel. We met a truck at this place and slowed up, and he had the usual grey face and he said, 'Sir, there is a dead G.I. in the middle of the road up ahead and every time any vehicle goes through they have to run over him and I'm afraid it is making a bad impression on the troops.' 'We'll get him off the road.' So we got him off the road. And I can remember just how he felt, lifting him, and how he had been flattened and the strangeness of his flatness. Then there was one other thing, I remember. We had put an awful lot of white phosphorus on the town before we got in for good, or whatever you would call it. That was the first time I ever saw a German dog eating a roasted German Kraut. Later on I saw a cat working on him too. It was a hungry cat, quite nice looking, basically. You wouldn't think a good German cat would eat a good German soldier, would you, Daughter? Or a good German dog eat a good German soldier's ass which had been roasted by white phosphorus. How many could you tell like that? Plenty, and what good would they do? You could tell a thousand and they would not prevent war. People would say we are not fighting the Krauts and besides the cat did not eat me nor my brother Gordon, because he was in the Pacific. Maybe land crabs ate Gordon. Or maybe he just deliquesced. In Hurtgen they just froze up hard; and it was so cold they froze up with ruddy faces. Very strange. They all were grey and yellow like wax-works, in the summer. But once the winter really came they had ruddy faces. Real soldiers never tell anyone what their own dead looked like, he told the portrait. And I'm through with this whole subject. And what about that company dead up the draw? What about them, professional soldier? They're dead, he said. And I can hang and rattle. Now who would join me in a glass of Valpolicella? What time do you think I should wake your opposite number, you girl? We have to get to that jewellery place. And I look forward to making jokes and to talking of the most cheerful things. What's cheerful, portrait? You ought to know. You're smarter than I am, although you haven't been around as much. All right, canvas girl, the Colonel told her, not saying it aloud, we'll drop the whole thing and in eleven minutes I will wake the live girl up and we will go out on the town and be cheerful and leave you here to be wrapped. I didn't mean to be rude. I was just joking roughly. I don't wish to be rude ever because I will be living with you from now on. I hope, he added, and drank a glass of the wine. Chapter XXXVI It was a sharp, cold bright day and they stood outside the window of the jeweller's shop and studied the two small negro heads and torsos that were carved to ebony and adorned with studded jewels. One was as good as the other, the Colonel thought. 'Which do you like the best, Daughter?' 'I think the one on the right. Don't you think he has the nicer face?' 'They both have nice faces. But I think I would rather have him attend you if it was the old days.' 'Good. We'll take him. Let's go in and see them. I must ask the price.' 'I will go in.' 'No, let me ask the price. They will charge me less than they would charge you. After all you are a rich American.' 'Et toi, Rimbaud?' 'You'd make an awfully funny Verlalne,' the girl told him. 'We'll be some other famous characters.' 'Go on to, Majesty, and we'll buy the God-damn jewel.' 'You wouldn't make a very good Louis XVI either.' 'I'd get up to that tumbril with you and still be able to spit.' 'Let's forget all the tumbrils and everyone's sorrows and buy the small object and then we can walk to Cipriani's and be famous people.' Inside the shop they looked at the two heads and she asked the price and then, there was some very rapid talk and the price was much lower. But still it was more money than the Colonel had. 'I'll go to Cipriani's and get some money.' 'No,' the girl said. Then to the clerk, 'Put it in a box and send it to Cipriani's and say the Colonel said to pay for it and hold it for him.' 'Please,' the clerk said. 'Exactly as you say.' They went out into the street and the sunlight and the unremitting wind. 'By the way,' the Colonel said. 'Your stones are in the safe at the Gritti in your name.' 'Your stones.' 'No,' he told her, not rough, but to make her understand truly. 'There are some things that a person cannot do. You know about that. You cannot marry me and I understand that, although I do not approve it.' 'Very well,' the girl said. 'I understand. But would you take one for a lucky stone?' 'No. I couldn't. They are too valuable.' 'But the portrait has value.' 'That is different.' 'Yes,' she agreed. 'I suppose so. I think I begin to understand.' 'I would accept a horse from you, if I was poor and young and riding very well. But I could not take a motor car.' 'I understand it now very well. Where can we go now, at this minute, where you can kiss me?' 'In this side alley, if you know no one who lives in it.' 'I don't care who lives in it. I want to feel you hold me tight and kiss me.' They turned into the side street and walked towards its blind end. 'Oh, Richard,' she said. 'Oh, my dear.' 'I love you.' 'Please love me.' 'I do.' The wind had blown her hair up and around his neck and he kissed her once more with it beating silkily against both his cheeks. Then she broke away, suddenly and hard, and looked at him and said, 'I suppose we had better go to Harry's.' 'I suppose so. Do you want to play historical personages?' 'Yes,' she said. 'Let us play that you are you and I am me.' 'Let's play,' the Colonel said. Chapter XXXVII There was no one in Harry's except some early morning drinkers that the Colonel did not know and two men that were doing business at the back of the bar. There were hours at Harry's when it filled with the people that you knew, with the same rushing regularity as the tide coming in at Mont St. Michel. Except, the Colonel thought, the hours of the tides change each day with the moon and the hours at Harry's are as the Greenwich Meridian, or the standard metre in Paris, or the good opinion the French military hold of themselves. 'Do you know any of these morning drinkers?' he asked the girl. 'No. I am not a morning drinker so I have never met them.' 'They will be swept out when the tide comes in.' 'No. They will leave, just as it comes, of their own accord.' 'Do you mind being here out of season?' 'Did you think I was a snob because I come from an old family? We're the ones who are not snobs. The snobs are what you call jerks and the people with all the new money. Did you ever see so much new money?' 'Yes,' the Colonel said. 'I saw it in Kansas City when I used to come in from Fort Riley to play polo at the Country Club.' 'Was it as bad as here?' 'No, it was quite pleasant. I liked it and that part of Kansas City is very beautiful.' 'Is it really? I wish that we could go there. Do they have the camps there too? The ones that we are going to stay at?' 'Surely. But we'll stay at the Muehlebach hotel which has the biggest beds in the world and we'll pretend that we are oil millionaires.' 'Where will we leave the Cadillac?' 'Is it a Cadillac now?' 'Yes. Unless you want to take the big Buick Roadmaster, with the Dynaflow drive. I've driven it all over Europe. It was in that last Vogue you sent me.' 'We'd probably better just use one at a time,' the Colonel said. 'Whichever one we decide to use we will park in the garage alongside the Muehlebach.' 'Is the Muehlebach very splendid?' 'Wonderful. You'll love it. When we leave town we'll drive north to St. Joe and have a drink in the bar at the Roubidoux, maybe two drinks and then we will cross the river and go west. You can drive and we can spell each other.' 'What is that?' 'Take turns driving.' 'I'm driving now.' 'Let's skip the dull part and get to Chimney Rock and go on to Scott's Bluff and Torrington and after that you will begin to see it.' 'I have the road maps and the guides and that man who says where to eat and the A.A.A. guide to the camps and the hotels.' 'Do you work on this much?' 'I work at it in the evenings, with the things you sent me. What kind of a licence will we have?' 'Missouri. We'll buy the car in Kansas City. We fly to Kansas City, don't you remember? Or we can go on a really good train.' 'I thought we flew to Albuquerque.' 'That was another time.' 'Will we stop early in the afternoons at the best Hotel in the A.A.A. book and I make you any drinks you want while you read the paper and Life and Time and Newsweek and I will read the new fresh Vogue and Harper's Bazaar? 'Yes. But we come back here, too.' 'Of course. With our car. On an Italian liner; whichever one is best then. We drive straight here from Genoa.' 'You don't want to stop anywhere for the night?' 'Why? We want to get home to our own house.' 'Where will our house be?' 'We can decide that any time. There are always plenty of houses in this town. Would you like to live in the country too?' 'Yes,' said the Colonel. 'Why not?' 'Then we could see the trees when we woke up. What sort of trees will we see on this journey?' 'Pine mostly and cotton-wood along the creeks and aspen. Wait till you see the aspen turn yellow in the fall.' 'I'm waiting. Where will we stay in Wyoming?' 'We'll go to Sheridan first and then decide.' 'Is Sheridan nice?' 'It's wonderful. In the car we'll drive to where they had the Wagon-Box Fight and I'll tell you about it. We will drive up, on the way to Billings, to where they killed that fool George Armstrong Custer and you can see the markers where everybody died and I'll explain the fight to you.' 'That will be wonderful. Which is Sheridan more like; Mantova or Verona or Vicenza?' 'It isn't like any of those. It is right up against the mountains, almost like Schio.' 'Is it like Cortina then?' 'Nothing like. Cortina is in a high valley in the mountains. Sheridan lays right up against them. There aren't any foothills to the Big Horns. They rise high out of the plateau. You can see Cloud's Peak.' 'Will our cars climb them properly?' 'You're damn right they will. But I would much rather not have any hydromatic drive.' 'I can do without it,' the girl said. Then she held herself straight and hard not to cry. 'As I can do without everything else.' 'What are you drinking?' the Colonel said. 'We haven't even ordered yet.' 'I don't think I will drink anything.' 'Two very dry Martinis,' the Colonel said to the bartender, 'and a glass of cold water.' He reached into his pocket and unscrewed the top of the medicine bottle and shook two of the big tablets into his left hand. With them in his hand, he screwed the top back on the bottle. It was no feat for a man with a bad right hand. 'I said I didn't want to drink anything.' 'I know, Daughter. But I thought you might need one. We can leave it on the bar. Or I can drink it myself. Please,' he said. 'I did not mean to be brusque.' 'We haven't asked for the little negro that will look after me.' 'No. Because I did not want to ask for him until Cipriani came in and I could pay for him.' 'Is everything that rigid?' 'With me, I guess,' the Colonel said. 'I'm sorry, Daughter.' 'Say daughter three times straight.' 'Hija, figlia, Daughter.' 'I don't know,' she said. 'I think we should just leave here. I love to have people see us, but I don't want to see anybody.' 'The box with the negro in it is on top of the cash register.' 'I know. I've seen it for some time.' The bar-tender came, with the two drinks, frost cold from the chilled coldness of the glasses and he brought the glass of water. 'Give me that small packet that came in my name and is on top of the cash register,' the Colonel said to him. 'Tell Cipriani I will send him a cheque for it.' He had made another decision. 'Do you want your drink, Daughter?' 'Yes. If you don't mind me changing my mind too.' They drank, after touching glasses very lightly, so lightly that the contact was almost imperceptible. 'You were right,' she said, feeling its warmth and its momentary destruction of sorrow. 'You were right too,' he said, and palmed the two tablets. He thought taking them with the water now, was in bad taste. So, when the girl turned her head a moment to watch a morning drinker go out to the door, he swallowed them with the Martini. 'Should we go, Daughter?' 'Yes. By all means.' 'Bar-tender,' the Colonel said. 'How much are these drinks? And do not forget to tell Cipriani I am sending him a cheque for this nonsense.' Chapter XXXVIII They ate lunch at the Gritti and the girl had unwrapped the small ebony negro's head and torso and pinned it high on her left shoulder. It was about three inches long and was quite lovely to look at if you liked that sort of thing. And if you don't you are stupid, the Colonel thought. But do not even think rough, he told himself. You have to be good now in every way until you say good-bye. What a word, he thought, good-bye. It sounds like a Valentine slogan. Good-bye and bonne chance and hasta la vista. We always just said merde and let it go at that. Farewell, he thought, that is a nice word. It sings well, he thought. Farewell, a long farewell and take it with you where you go. With handles, he thought. 'Daughter,' he said. 'How long has it been since I told you that I loved you?' 'Not since we sat at the table.' 'I tell you now.' She had combed her hair with patience when they came into the hotel and she had gone into the room for women. She disliked such rooms. She had used lipstick to make the sort of mouth she knew he most desired and she had said to herself, making the mouth correctly, 'Don't think at all. Don't think. Above all don't be sad because he is going now.' 'You look beautiful.' 'Thank you. I would like to be beautiful for you if I could and if I could be beautiful.' 'Italian is a lovely language.' 'Yes. Mister Dante thought so.' 'Gran Maestro,' the Colonel said. 'What is there to eat in this Wirtschaft?' The Gran Maestro had been observing, without observing, with affection and without envy. 'Do you want meat, or fish?' 'It's Saturday,' the Colonel said. 'Fish is not compulsory. So I'll take it.' 'It is sole,' the Gran Maestro said. 'What do you want, my Lady?' 'Whatever you decide. You know more about food than I do and I like it all.' 'Make a decision, Daughter.' 'No. I would rather leave it to someone who knows more than me. I have a boarding-school appetite.' 'It will come as a surprise,' the Gran Maestro said with his long and loving face with the grey eyebrows over the softly hooded eyes and the ever happy face of the old soldier who is still alive and appreciates it. 'Is there any news from the Order?' the Colonel asked. 'Only that our leader, Himself, is in trouble. They have confiscated everything he owns. Or at any rate they have intervened.' 'I hope it is not serious.' 'We will have confidence in our leader. He has ridden out worse tempests than this.' 'To our leader,' the Colonel said. He raised his glass, which had been filled with the decanted new and true Valpolicella. 'Drink to him, Daughter.' 'I can't drink to that swine,' the girl said. 'Besides I do not belong to the Order.' 'You are a member now,' the Gran Maestro said. 'Por merito di guerra.' 'I'll drink to him then,' she said. 'Am I really a member of the Order?' 'Yes,' the Gran Maestro said. 'You have not received your parchment yet but I appoint you Super Honorary Secretary. My Colonel will reveal to you the secrets of the Order. Reveal, please, my Colonel.' 'I reveal', the Colonel said. 'There are no pitted folk about?' 'No. He is out with his Lady. Miss Baedeker.' 'O.K. then,' the Colonel said. 'I will reveal. There is only the major secret that you must know. Correct me, Gran Maestro, if I fall into error.' 'Proceed to reveal,' the Gran Maestro said. 'I proceed to reveal,' the Colonel said. 'Listen carefully, Daughter. This is the Supreme Secret. Listen. 'Love is love and fun is fun. But it is always so quiet when the gold fish die.' 'It has been revealed,' the Gran Maestro said. 'I am very proud and happy to be a member of the Order,' the girl said. 'But it is, in a way, a rather rough Order.' 'It is indeed,' the Colonel said. 'And now, Gran Maestro, what do we actually eat; without mysteries?' 'Some crab enchillada, in the style of this town, but cold, first. Served in the shell. Then sole for you and for my lady a mixed grill. What vegetables?' 'Whatever you have,' the Colonel said. The Gran Maestro was gone and the Colonel looked at the girl and then at the Grand Canal outside the window and he saw the magic spots and changes of light that were even here, in the end of the bar, which had now by skilful handling been made into a dining-room, and he said, 'Did I tell you, Daughter, that I love you?' 'You haven't told me for quite a long time. But I love you.' 'What happens to people that love each other?' 'I suppose they have whatever they have and they are more fortunate than others. Then one of them gets the emptiness for ever.' 'I won't be rough,' the Colonel said. 'I could have made a rough response. But please don't have any emptiness.' 'I'll try,' the girl said. 'I've been trying ever since I woke up. I've tried ever since we knew each other.' 'Keep on trying, Daughter,' the Colonel said. Then to the Grand Maestro, who had reappeared, having given his orders, the Colonel said, 'A bottle of that vino secco, from Vesuvius, for the small soles. We have the Valpolicella for the other things.' 'Can't I drink the Vesuvius wine with my mixed grill?' the girl asked. 'Renata, Daughter,' the Colonel said. 'Of course. You can do anything.' 'I like to drink the same wines as you if I drink wine.' 'Good white wine is good with a mixed grill, at your age,' the Colonel told her. 'I wish there was not such a difference in ages.' 'I like it very much,' the Colonel said. 'Except,' he added. Then he did not continue and said, 'Let's be fraÃ®che et rose comme au jour de bataille.' 'Who said that?' 'I haven't the slightest idea. I picked it up when I took a course at the CollÃ¨ge des MarÃ©chaux. A rather pretentious title. But I graduated. What I know best I learned from the Krauts, studying them and opposing them. They are the best soldiers. But they always over-reach.' 'Let's be like you said and please tell me that you love me.' 'I love you,' he said. 'That's what you can base on. I tell you truly.' 'It is Saturday,' she said. 'And when is next Saturday?' 'Next Saturday is a movable feast, Daughter. Find me a man who can tell me about next Saturday.' 'You could tell me if you would.' 'I'll ask the Gran Maestro, maybe he knows. Gran Maestro, when will next Saturday come?' 'A PÃ¢ques ou Ã  la TrinitÃ©,' the Gran Maestro said. 'Why don't we have any smells from the kitchen to cheer us up?' 'Because the wind is from the wrong direction.' Yes, the Colonel thought. The wind is from the wrong direction and how lucky I would have been to have had this girl instead of the woman that I pay alimony to, who could not even make a child. She hired out for that. But who should criticize whose tubes? I only criticize Goodrich or Firestone or General. Keep it clean, he said to himself. And love your girl. She was there beside him, wishing to be loved, if he had any love to give. It came back, as it always had, when he saw her and he said, 'How are you with the crow wing hair and the break-heart face?' 'I'm fine.' 'Gran Maestro,' the Colonel said. 'Produce a few smells or something from your off-stage kitchen, even if the wind is against us.' Chapter XXXIX The hall porter had telephoned, under the direction of the concierge, and it was the same motor boat that they had ridden in before. T5 Jackson was in the boat with the luggage and the portrait, which had been well and sturdily wrapped. It was still blowing hard. The Colonel had paid his bill and made the proper tips. The people of the hotel had put the luggage and the picture in the boat and seen that Jackson was seated properly. Then they had retired. 'Well, Daughter,' the Colonel said. 'Can't I ride with you to the garage?' 'It would be just as bad at the garage.' 'Please let me ride to the garage.' 'All right,' the Colonel said. 'It's your show, really. Get in.' They did not talk at all and the wind was a stern wind so that, with what speed the old calamity of a motor made, there seemed almost to be no wind at all. At the landing place, where Jackson was handing the luggage to a porter and looking after the portrait himself, the Colonel said, 'Do you want to say good-bye here?' 'Do I have to?' 'No.' 'May I come up to the bar in the garage while they are getting the car down?' 'That will be worse.' 'I do not care.' 'Get that stuff up to the garage and have somebody look after it until you get the car down,' the Colonel said to Jackson. 'Check on my guns and pack this stuff in a way to give the maximum space in the rear seat.' 'Yes, sir,' Jackson said. 'Am I going then?' the girl asked. 'No,' the Colonel told her. 'Why can't I go?' 'You know very well. You weren't invited.' 'Please don't be bad.' 'Christ, Daughter, if you knew how hard I am trying not to be. It's easy if you're bad. Let's pay this good man off and go over and sit on the bench there under the tree.' He paid the owner of the motor boat and told him that he had not forgotten about the jeep engine. He also told him not to count on it, but that there was a good chance that he could get it. 'It will be a used engine. But it will be better than that coffee pot you have in there now.' They went up the worn stone steps and walked across the gravel and sat on a bench under the trees. The trees were black and moved in the wind and there were no leaves on them. The leaves had fallen early that year and been swept up long ago. A man came over to offer postcards for sale and the Colonel told him, 'Run along, son. We don't need you now.' The girl was crying, finally, although she had made the decision never to cry. 'Look, Daughter,' the Colonel said. 'There isn't anything to say. They didn't instal shock-absorbers in this vehicle we ride in now.' 'I've stopped,' she said. 'I'm not an hysterical.' 'I wouldn't say you were. I'd say you were the loveliest and most beautiful girl that ever lived. Any time. Any place. Anywhere.' 'If it were true, what difference would it make?' 'You have me there,' the Colonel said. 'But it is true.' 'So now what?' 'So now we stand up and kiss each other and say good-bye.' 'What's that?' 'I don't know,' the Colonel said. 'I guess that is one of the things everybody has to figure out for themselves.' 'I'll try to figure it.' 'Just take it as easy as you can, Daughter.' 'Yes,' the girl said. 'In the vehicle without the shock-absorbers.' 'You were tumbril bait from the start.' 'Can't you do anything kindly?' 'I guess not. But I've tried.' 'Please keep on trying. That's all the hope we have.' 'I'll keep on trying.' So they held each other close and kissed each other hard and true and the Colonel took the girl across the stretch of gravel and down the stone steps. 'You ought to take a good one. Not that old displaced engine boat.' 'I'd rather take the displaced engine boat if you don't mind.' 'Mind?' the Colonel said. 'Not me. I only give orders and obey orders. I don't mind. Good-bye, my dear, lovely, beautiful.' 'Good-bye,' she said. Chapter XL He was in the sunken oak hogshead that they used in the Veneto for blinds. A blind is any artifice you use to hide the shooter from that which he is attempting to shoot, which, in this case, were ducks. It had been a good trip out with the boys, once they had met in the garage and a good evening with excellent food cooked on the old open-hearth kitchen. Three shooters rode in the rear seat, on the way to the shooting place. Those who did not lie had permitted themselves a certain amount of exaggeration and the liars had never been in fuller flower. A liar, in full flower, the Colonel had thought, is as beautiful as cherry trees, or apple trees when they are in blossom. Who should ever discourage a liar, he thought, unless he is giving you co-ordinates? The Colonel had collected liars all his life, as some men gather postage stamps. He did not classify them, except at the moment, nor treasure them truly. He just enjoyed, completely, hearing them lie at the moment, unless, of course, something concerned with duty was involved. Last night there had been a fair amount of good lying after the grappa had been passed around and the Colonel had enjoyed it. There had been smoke in the room from the open charcoal fire; no, there were logs, he thought. Anyway a liar lies best when there is a little smoke or when the sun has set. He had come close to lying twice himself and had held it up and merely exaggerated. I hope anyway, he thought. Now here was the frozen lagoon to ruin everything. But it was not ruined. A pair of pin-tails came, suddenly, from nowhere, slanting down fast in a dive no aeroplane ever made, and the Colonel heard their feathered trajectory and swung and killed the drake. He lay on the ice, hitting it as solid as a duck can hit ice and, before he was down, the Colonel had killed his mate, who was climbing, long-necked and fast. She fell alongside the drake. So it is murder, the Colonel thought. And what isn't nowadays? But, boy, you can still shoot. Boy, hell, he thought. You beat-up old bastard. But look at them come now. They were widgeon and they came in a whisp that coagulated and then stretched to nothing. Then they coagulated again and the treacherous duck on the ice started to talk to them. Let them turn once more, the Colonel said to himself. Keep your head down and do not move even your eyes. They are going to come in. They came in well, with treachery speaking to them. Their wings were suddenly set to alight, as when you lower the flaps. Then they saw it was ice and they rose, climbing. The shooter, who was not a Colonel now, nor anything but a gun handler, rose in the wooden barrel and got two. They hit the ice almost as solidly as the big ducks. Two is enough from one family, the Colonel said. Or was it one tribe? The Colonel heard a shot behind him, where he knew there was no other blind and turned his head to look across the frozen lagoon to the far, sedge-lined shore. That does it, he thought. A bunch of mallards, that had been coming in low, were flaring up into the sky, seeming to stand on their tails as they climbed. He saw one fall, then heard another shot. It was the sullen boatman shooting at the ducks that would have come to the Colonel. How, how can he do that? The Colonel thought. The man had a shot-gun to shoot any cripples that might be escaping where the dog could not get them. For him to fire at ducks that were coming to the Colonel's blind was, in shooting, as bad a thing as one man could do to another. The boatman was too far away to hear a shout. So the Colonel fired at him twice. It is too far for the pellets to reach, he thought, but at least he will know that I know what he is doing. What the hell is this all about? On a beautifully run shoot like this one too? This is the best organized and best run duck shoot I have ever shot at and I have had as much fun shooting here as I ever had in my life. What is the matter with that son of a bitch? He knew how bad his anger was for him. So he took two of the pills and washed them down with a drink of Gordon's gin from his flask since there was no water. He knew the gin was bad for him too and he thought, everything is bad for me except rest and very light exercise. O.K., rest and light exercise, boy. Do you suppose that is light exercise? You, beauty, he said to himself. I wish you were here now and we were in the double blind and if we could only just feel the backs of our shoulders touch. I'd look around and see you and I would shoot the high ducks well, to show off and try to put one in the blind without having it hit you. I'd try to pull one down like this, he said, hearing the wings in the air. He rose, turned, saw the single drake, long-necked and beautiful, the wings fast moving and travelling to the sea. He saw him sharp and clear and in the sky with the mountains behind him. He met him, covered him and pulled as he swung as far back as he could swing the gun. The drake came down on the ice, just outside the perimeter of the blind and broke the ice as he fell. It was the ice that had been broken to put out the decoys and it had re-frozen lightly. The calling hen looked at him as he lay and shifted her feet. 'You never saw him before in your life,' the Colonel said to the hen. 'I don't believe you even saw him coming. Though you may have. But you didn't say anything.' The drake had hit with his head down and his head was under the ice. But the Colonel could see the beautiful winter plumage on his breast and wings. I'd like to give her a vest made of the whole plumage the way the old Mexicans used to ornament their gods, he thought. But I suppose these ducks have to go to the market and no one would know how to skin and cure the skins anyway. It could be beautiful, though, with mallard drake skins for the back and sprig for the front with two longitudinal stripes of teal. One coming down over each breast. Be a hell of a vest. I'm pretty sure she'd like it. I wish they would fly, the Colonel thought. A few fool ducks might come in. I have to stay ready for them if they do. But none came in and he had to think. There were no shots from the other blinds and only occasional shots from the sea. With the good light, the birds could see the ice and they no longer came in and instead went out to the open sea to raft up. So he had no shooting and he thought without intention, trying to find what had made it at the first. He knew he did not deserve it and he accepted it and he lived by it, but he sought, always, to understand it. One time it had been two sailors when he had been walking with the girl at night. They had whistled at her and, the Colonel thought, that was a harmless enough thing and he should have let it go. But there was something wrong with it. He sensed it before he knew it. Then he knew it solidly, because he had stopped under a light, in order that they might see what he wore on his shoulders, so that they might take the other side of the street. What he wore on each shoulder was a small eagle with wings outstretched. It was embroidered on to the coat he wore in silver thread. It was not conspicuous and it had been there a long time. But it was visible. The two sailors whistled again. 'Stay over there against the wall if you want to watch it,' the Colonel had said to the girl. 'Or look away.' 'They are very big and young.' 'They won't be big for long,' the Colonel promised her. The Colonel walked over to the whistlers. 'Where is your shore patrol?' he asked. 'How would I know?' the biggest whistler said. 'All I want is a good look at the dame.' 'Do people like you have names and serial numbers?' 'How would I know?' said one. The other said, 'I wouldn't tell a chicken Colonel if I had.' Old army boy, the Colonel thought, before he hit him. Sea lawyer. Knows all his rights. But he hit him with a left from nowhere and hit him three times as he started to go. The other one, the first whistler, had closed fast and well, for a man who had been drinking, and the Colonel gave him the elbow in the mouth and then, under the light, had a good right hand shot at him. When it was in, he glanced at the second whistler and saw that was okay. Then he threw a left hook. Then he put the right way into the body, coming up. He threw another left hook and then turned away and walked towards the girl because he did not want to hear the head hit the pavement. He checked on the one that had it first and noted he slept peacefully, chin down, with the blood coming out of his mouth. But it was still the right colour, the Colonel noted. 'Well, there goes my career,' he said to the girl. 'Whatever that was. But those people certainly wear funny pants.' 'How are you?' the girl asked. 'I'm fine. Did you watch it?' 'Yes.' 'I'll have bad hands in the morning,' he said absent mindedly. 'But I think we can walk away from it all right. But let's walk slowly.' 'Please walk slowly.' 'I did not mean it that way. I mean let's not be hurried in our departure.' 'We will walk as slowly as two people can walk.' So they walked. 'Do you want to try an experiment?' 'Of course.' 'Let's walk so we make even the backs of our legs look dangerous.' 'I'll try. But I don't think I can.' 'Well, let's just walk then.' 'But didn't they hit you?' 'One pretty good right behind the ear. The second boy when he came in.' 'Is that what fighting's like?' 'When you're lucky.' 'And when you're not lucky?' 'Your knees bend too. Either forward or backward.' 'Do you still care for me after you have fought?' 'I love you much more than before if it were possible.' 'Can't it be possible? It would be nice. I love you more since I saw that thing. Am I walking slowly enough?' 'You walk like a deer in the forest and sometimes you walk as well as a wolf, or an old, big coyote when he is not hurried.' 'I'm not sure I wish to be an old big coyote.' 'Wait till you see one,' the Colonel said. 'You'll wish. You walk like all the great predators, when they walk softly. And you are not a predator.' 'That I can promise.' 'Walk a little ahead so I can see.' She walked ahead and the Colonel said, 'You walk like a champion before he is the champion. If you were a horse I would buy you if I had to borrow the money at twenty per cent a month.' 'You don't have to buy me.' 'I know about that. That was not what we were discussing. We were discussing your gait.' 'Tell me,' she said. 'What happens to those men? That's one of the things I don't know about fighting. Shouldn't I have stayed and cared for them?' 'Never,' the Colonel told her. 'Remember that; never. I hope they split a good concussion between them. They can rot. They caused the accident. There is no question of civil responsibility. We were all insured. If I can tell you one thing, Renata, about fighting.' 'Tell me, please.' 'If you ever fight, then you must win it. That's all that counts. All the rest is cabbage, as my old friend Dr. Rommel put it.' 'Did you really like Rommel?' 'Very much.' 'But he was your enemy.' 'I love my enemies, sometimes, more than my friends. And the Navy, you know, wins all their fights always. This I learned in a place called the Pentagon building when I was still permitted to enter that building by the front door. If you like we can stroll back down this street, or walk it fast and ask those two that question.' 'I tell you truly, Richard. I have seen enough fighting for one night.' 'Me too, to tell the truth,' the Colonel said. But he said it in Italian and it started, 'Anche io. Let's go to Harry's for one, and then I will walk you home.' 'Didn't you hurt your bad hand?' 'No,' he explained. 'I only threw it once to the head. The other times I punched to the body with it.' 'May I feel it?' 'If you will feel very softly.' 'But it is terribly swollen.' 'There is nothing broken in it and that sort of swelling always goes down.' 'Do you love me?' 'Yes. I love you with two moderately swollen hands and all my heart.' Chapter XLI So that was that and maybe it was that day or maybe it was another that made the miracle. You never knew, he thought. There was the great miracle and he had never consciously implemented it. Nor, he thought, you son of a bitch, did you ever oppose it. It was colder than ever and the broken ice re-froze and the calling duck did not even look up now. She had abandoned treachery for an attempt at security. You bitch, the Colonel thought. Though that is unjust. It is your trade. But why is it a hen calls better than a drake. You ought to know, he thought. And even that's not true. What the hell is true? Drakes actually call better. Now don't think of her. Don't think of Renata because it won't do you any good, boy. It might even be bad for you. Also you said good-bye. What a good-bye that was. Complete with tumbrils. And she would have climbed up in the damned tumbril with you too. Just so long as it was a real tumbril. Very rough trade, he thought. Loving and leaving. People can get hurt at it. Who gave you a right to know a girl like that? Nobody, he answered. But Andrea introduced me to her. But how could she love a sad son of a bitch like you? I do not know, he thought truly. I truly do not know. He did not know, among other things, that the girl loved him because he had never been sad one waking morning of his life; attack or no attack. He had experienced anguish and sorrow. But he had never been sad in the morning. They make almost none like that and the girl, although she was a young girl, knew one when she saw one. Now she is at home and sleeping, the Colonel thought. That is where she ought to be and not in any god-damn duck blind with the decoys frozen up on us. I wish to hell she was here though, if this were a double blind and have her looking to the west just in case one string did come in. It would be nice if she were warm enough. Maybe I can trade somebody out of one of these real down jackets that nobody ever sold that had one. The kind they issued to the Air Force once by mistake. I could find out how they are quilted and make one with duck down from here, he thought. I'd get a good tailor to cut it and we would make it double-breasted with no pocket on the right and lay in a chamois shooting patch so the gun butt would never catch. I'll do it, he said to himself. I'll do it, or I will get one off some joker and have it cut down for her. I'd like to get her a good Purdey 12, not too damn light, or a pair of Boss over and unders. She should have guns as good as she is. I suppose a pair of Purdey's, he thought. Just then he heard the light swish of pinions, fast beating in the air, and looked up. But they were too high. He only looked up with his eyes. But they were so high they could see the barrel with him in it and the frozen-in decoys with the dejected hen, who saw them too and quacked hard in her loyal treachery. The ducks, they were pin-tails, continued on their flight out towards the sea. I never gave her anything, as she pointed out. There was the small moor's head. But it does not mean anything. She selected it and I bought it. That is no way to give a gift. What I would like to give her is security, which does not exist any more; all my love, which is worthless; all my worldly goods, which are practically non-existent except for two good shot-guns, my soldier suits, the medals and decorations with the citations and some books. Also a retired Colonel's pay. With all my worldly goods I thee endow, he thought. And she gave me her love, some hard stones, which I returned, and the picture. Well, I can always give her back the picture. I could give her my ring from V.M.I., he thought, but where the hell did I lose that? She wouldn't want a D.S.C. with cluster, nor two silver stars, nor the other junk, nor the medals of her own country. Nor those of France. Nor those of Belgium. Nor the trick ones. That would be morbid. I better just give her my love. But how the hell do you send it? And how do you keep it fresh? They can't pack it in dry ice. Maybe they can. I must inquire. But how do I get that condemned jeep engine to that old man? Figure it out, he thought. Figuring things out has been your trade. Figuring things out when they were shooting at you, he added. I wish that son of a bitch that is lousing up the duck shooting had a rifle and I had a rifle. We would find out pretty soon who could figure things out. Even in a lousy barrel in a marsh where you can't manoeuvre. He'd have to come to get me. Stop that, he said to himself, and think about your girl. You do not want to kill anyone any more; ever. Who are you feeding that to, he told himself. You going to run as a Christian? You might give it an honest try. She would like you better that way. Or would she? I don't know, he said frankly. I honest to God don't know. Maybe I will get Christian towards the end. Yes, he said, maybe you will. Who wants to make a bet on that? 'You want to bet on that?' he asked the calling duck. But she was looking up at the sky behind him and had commenced her small chuckling talk. They came over too high and never circled. They only looked down and went on towards the open sea. They must really be rafted up out there, the Colonel thought. There's probably some punt gunner trying to sneak up on them now. They will be pretty close into the lee with the wind and someone is sneaking on to them now surely. Well, when he makes his shot some may break back this way. But with it frozen-up I suppose I really ought to pull out instead of staying here like a fool. I have killed enough and I have shot as well or better than I can shoot. Better hell, he thought. Nobody shoots better than you here except Alvarito and he's a kid and shoots faster. But you kill fewer ducks than many bad and fair shots. Yes, I know about that. I know about that and why and we don't go by the numbers any more and we threw away the book too, remember? He remembered how, by some miracle of chance in a war, he had been with his best friend for a moment in action in the Ardennes and they were pursuing. It was early fall and it was on a high upland with sandy roads and trails and the trees were scrub oak and pines. The enemy tank and half track prints showed clearly in the moist sand. It had rained the day before, but now it was clearing and visibility was good and you could see well across all the high, rolling country and he and his friend were glassing it as carefully as though they were hunting game. The Colonel, who was a General then and an assistant divisional commander, knew the individual print of each tracked vehicle they were pursuing. He also knew when the enemy vehicles had run out of mines and approximately the number of rounds that remained to them. He also had figured where they had to fight before they reached the Siegfried. He was sure they would not fight at either of these two places but would race for where they were going. 'We're pretty far up for people of our exalted rank, George,' he said to his best friend. 'Ahead of the point, General.' 'It's okay,' the Colonel had said. 'Now we throw away the book and chase for keeps.' 'I couldn't agree more fully, General. Because I wrote the book myself,' his best friend said. 'But suppose they had left something there?' He pointed to the logical place to defend. 'They didn't leave anything there,' the Colonel had said. 'They haven't enough stuff left even for a fire-fight.' 'Everybody's right until he's wrong,' his best friend said, adding, 'General.' 'I'm right,' the Colonel said. He was right, too, although in obtaining his exact knowledge he had not fulfilled the complete spirit of the Geneva Convention which was alleged to govern the operation of war. 'Let's really chase,' his best friend had said. 'There's nothing holding us up and I guarantee they won't stop at either of those two. I didn't get that from any Kraut either. That's from my head.' He looked over the country once more, and heard the wind in the trees and smelled the heather under their boots and looked once more at the tracks in the wet sand and that was the end of that story. I wonder if she'd like that? he thought. No. It builds me up too much. I'd like to get somebody else to tell it to her though and build me solid. George can't tell it to her. He's the only one that could tell it to her and he can't. He sure as hell can't. I've been right over ninety-five per cent of the time and that's a hell of a batting average even in something as simple as war. But that five per cent when you are wrong can certainly be something. I'll never tell you about that, Daughter. That's just a noise heard off stage in my heart. My lousy chicken heart. That bastard heart certainly couldn't hold the pace. Maybe he will, he thought, and took two of the tablets and a swallow of gin and looked across the grey ice. I'm going to get that sullen character in now and pick up and get the hell to the farm house or the lodge, I suppose that I should call it. The shooting's over. Chapter XLII The colonel had signalled the boatman in by standing up, in the sunken barrel, firing two shots towards the empty sky, and then waving him towards the blind. The boat came in slowly, breaking ice all the way, and the man picked up the wooden decoys, caught the calling hen and put her in her sack, and, with the dog slithering on the ice, picked up the ducks. The boatman's anger seemed to be gone and to be replaced by a solid satisfaction. 'You shot very few,' he said to the Colonel. 'With your help.' That was all they said and the boatman placed the ducks carefully, breasts up, on the bow of the boat, and the Colonel handed his guns and the combination cartridge box and shooting stool into the boat. The Colonel got into the boat and the boatman checked the blind and unhooked the pocketed, apron-like device which had hung on the inside of the blind to hold shells. Then he got into the boat too and they commenced their slow and laborious progress out through the ice to the open water of the brown canal. The Colonel worked as hard with the poling oar as he had worked coming in. But now, in the bright sunlight, with the snow mountains to the north, and the line of the sedge that marked the canal ahead of them, they worked together in complete co-ordination. Then they were into the canal, slipping breakingly in from the last ice; then, suddenly, light-borne and the Colonel handed the big oar to the boatman and sat down. He was sweating. The dog, who had been shivering at the Colonel's feet, pawed his way over the gunwale of the boat and swam to the canal bank. Shaking the water from his white bedraggled coat, he was into the brown sedge and brush, and the Colonel watched his progress towards home by the movement of the brush. He had never received his sausage. The Colonel, feeling himself sweating, although he knew he was protected from the wind by his field jacket, took two tablets from the bottle and a sip of gin from his flask. The flask was flat and of silver with a leather cover. Under the leather cover, which was worn and stained, it was engraved, on one side, to Richard From Renata With Love. No one had ever seen this inscription except the girl, the Colonel and the man who had engraved it. It had not been engraved in the same place it was purchased. That was in the earliest days, the Colonel thought. Now who cared? On the screw-on top of the flask was engraved From R. to R.C. The Colonel offered the flask to the boatman who looked at him, at the flask, and said, 'What is it?' 'English grappa.' 'I'll try it.' He took a long drink of it; the type of drink peasants take from a flask. 'Thank you.' 'Did you have good shooting?' 'I killed four ducks. The dog found three cripples shot by other people.' 'Why did you shoot?' 'I'm sorry that I shot. I shot in anger.' I have done that myself sometimes, the Colonel thought, and did not ask him what the anger was about. 'I am sorry they did not fly better.' 'That's the way things go,' the Colonel said. The Colonel was watching the movement the dog made in the high grass and sedge. Suddenly he saw him stop; he was quite still. Then he pounced. It was a high leap and a dive forward and down. 'He has a crippled,' he said to the boatman. 'Bobby,' the boatman called. 'Bring. Bring.' The sedge moved and the dog came out with a mallard drake in his jaws. The grey-white neck and the green head were swaying up and down as a snake's might move. It was a movement without hope. The boatman put the boat in sharp for shore. 'I'll take him,' the Colonel said. 'Bobby!' He took the duck from the dog's light-holding mouth and felt him intact and sound and beautiful to hold, and with his heart beating and his captured, hopeless eyes. He looked at him carefully, gentling him as you might gentle a horse. 'He's only wing-tipped,' he said. 'We'll keep him for a caller or to turn loose in the spring. Here, take him and put him in the sack with the hen.' The boatman took him carefully and put him in the burlap bag that was under the bow. The Colonel heard the hen speak to him. Or, maybe she is protesting, he thought. He could not understand duck-talk through a burlap bag. 'Take a shot of this,' he said to the boatman. 'It's damned cold to-day.' The boatman took the flask and drank deeply again. 'Thank you,' he said. 'Your grappa is very, very good.' Chapter XLIII At the landing, before the long low stone house by the side of the canal, there were ducks laid out on the ground In rows. They were laid in groups that were never of the same number. There were a few platoons, no companies, and, the Colonel drought, I barely have a squad. The head game-keeper was standing on the bank in his high boots, his short jacket and his pushed back old felt hat, and he looked critically at the number of ducks on the bow of the boat as they came alongshore. 'It was frozen-up at our post,' the Colonel said. 'I suspected so,' the head keeper said. 'I'm sorry. It was supposed to be the best post.' 'Who was top gun?' 'The Barone killed forty-two. There was a little current there that kept it open for a while. You probably did not hear the shooting because it was against the wind.' 'Where is everyone?' 'They're all gone except the Barone who is waiting for you. Your driver is asleep in the house.' 'He would be,' the Colonel said. 'Spread those out properly,' the head-keeper told the boatman who was a game-keeper too. 'I want to put them to the game book.' 'There is one green-head drake in the bag who is only wing-tipped.' 'Good. I will take good care of him.' 'I will go inside and see the Barone. I'll see you later.' 'You must get warm,' the head keeper said. 'It's been a bitter day, my Colonel.' The Colonel started to walk towards the door of the house. 'I'll see you later,' he said to the boatman. 'Yes, my Colonel,' the boatman said. Alvarito, the Barone, was standing by the open fire in the middle of the room. He smiled his shy smile and said to his low-pitched voice, 'I am sorry you did not have better shooting.' 'We froze up completely. I enjoyed what there was very much.' 'Are you very cold?' 'Not too cold.' 'We can have something to eat.' 'Thank you. I'm not hungry. Have you eaten?' 'Yes. The others went on and I let them take my car. Can you give me a lift to Latisana or just above? I can get transportation from there.' 'Of course.' 'It was a shame that it should freeze. The prospects were so good.' 'There must have been a world of ducks outside.' 'Yes. But now they won't stay with their feed frozen over. They will be on their way south to-night.' 'Will they all go?' 'All except our local ducks that breed here. They'll stay as long as there is any open water.' 'I'm sorry for the shoot.' 'I'm sorry you came so far for so few ducks.' 'I always love the shoot,' the Colonel said. 'And I love Venice.' The Barone Alvarito looked away and spread his hands towards the fire. 'Yes,' he said. 'We all love Venice. Perhaps you do the best of all.' The Colonel made no small talk on this but said, 'I love Venice as you know.' 'Yes. I know,' the Barone said. He looked at nothing. Then he said, 'We must wake your driver.' 'Has he eaten?' 'Eaten and slept and eaten and slept. He has also read a little in some illustrated books he brought with him.' 'Comic books,' the Colonel said. 'I should learn to read them,' the Barone said. He smiled the shy, dark smile. 'Could you get me some from Trieste?' 'Any amount,' the Colonel told him. 'From superman on up into the improbable. Read some for me. Look, Alvarito, what was the matter with that game-keeper who poled my boat? He seemed to have a hatred for me at the start. Pretty well through, too.' 'It was the old battle-jacket. Allied uniform affects him that way. You see he was a bit over-liberated.' 'Go on.' 'When the Moroccans came through here they raped both his wife and his daughter.' 'I think I'd better have a drink,' the Colonel said. 'There is grappa there on the table.' Chapter XLIV They had dropped the Barone off at a villa with great gates, a gravelled drive and a house, which, since it was over six miles from any military objective, had the good fortune not to have been bombed. The Colonel had said good-bye and Alvarito had told him to come down and shoot any, or every, week-end. 'You're sure you won't come in?' 'No. I must get back to Trieste. Will you give my love to Renata?' 'I will. Is that her portrait that you have wrapped up in the back of the car?' 'It is.' 'I'll tell her that you shot very well and that the portrait was in good condition.' 'Also my love.' 'Also your love.' 'Ciao, Alvarito, and thank you very much.' 'Ciao, my Colonel. If one can say ciao to a Colonel.' 'Consider me not a Colonel.' 'It is very difficult. Good-bye, my Colonel.' 'In case of any unforeseen contingencies would you ask her to have the portrait picked up at the Gritti?' 'Yes, my Colonel.' 'That's all, I guess.' 'Good-bye, my Colonel.' Chapter XLV They were out on the road now and the early darkness was beginning. 'Turn left,' the Colonel said. 'That's not the road for Trieste, sir,' Jackson said. 'The hell with the road to Trieste. I ordered you to turn left. Do you think there is only one way in the world to get to Trieste?' 'No, sir. I was only pointing out to the Colonelâ€”â€”' 'Don't you point me out a God-damn thing and until I direct you otherwise, don't speak to me until you are spoken to.' 'Yes, sir.' 'I'm sorry, Jackson. What I mean is I know where I'm going and I want to think.' 'Yes, sir.' They were on the old road that he knew so well and the Colonel thought, well, I sent four of the ducks I promised to those I promised them to at the Gritti. There wasn't enough shooting to be enough feathers to do that boy's wife any good with feathers. But they are all big ducks and fat and they will be good eating. I forgot to give Bobby the sausage. There was no time to write Renata a note. But what could I say, in a note, that we did not say? He reached into his pocket and found a pad and pencil. He put on the map-reading light, and with his bad hand, printed a short message in block letters. 'Put that in your pocket, Jackson, and act on it if necessary. If the circumstances described occur, it is an order.' 'Yes, sir,' Jackson said, and took the folded order blank with one hand and put it in the top left-hand pocket of his tunic. Now take it easy, the Colonel said to himself. Any further concern you may have is about yourself and that is just a luxury. You are no longer of any real use to the Army of the United States. That has been made quite clear. You have said good-bye to your girl and she has said good-bye to you. That is certainly simple. You shot well and Alvarito understands. That is that. So what the hell do you have to worry about, boy? I hope you're not the type of jerk who worries about what happens to him when there's nothing to be done. Let's certainly hope not. Just then it hit him as he had known it would since they had picked up the decoys. Three strikes is out, he thought, and they gave me four. I've always been a lucky son of a bitch. It hit him again badly. 'Jackson,' he said. 'Do you know what General Thomas J. Jackson said on one occasion? On the occasion of his unfortunate death. I memorized it once. I can't respond for its accuracy of course. But this is how it was reported: "Order A. P. Hill to prepare for action." Then some more delirious stuff. Then he said, "No, no, let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of the trees."' 'That's very interesting, sir,' Jackson said. 'That must have been Stonewall Jackson, sir.' The Colonel started to speak but he stopped while it hit him the third time and gripped bun so he knew he could not live. 'Jackson,' the Colonel said. 'Pull up at the side of the road and cut to your parking lights. Do you know the way to Trieste from here?' 'Yes, sir, I have my map.' 'Good. I'm now going to get into the large back seat of this god-damned, over-sized luxurious automobile.' That was the last thing the Colonel ever said. But he made the back seat all right and he shut the door. He shut it carefully and well. After a while Jackson drove the car down the ditch and willow lined road with the car's big lights on, looking for a place to turn. He found one, finally, and turned carefully. When he was on the right-hand side of the road, facing south towards the road junction that would put him on the highway that led to Trieste, the one he was familiar with, he put his map light on and took out the order blank and read: IN THE EVENT OF MY DEATH THE WRAPPED PAINTING AND THE TWO SHOT GUNS IN THIS CAR WILL BE RETURNED TO THE HOTEL GRITTI WHERE THEY WILL BE CLAIMED BY THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNER SIGNED RICHARD CANTWELL, COL., INFANTRY, U.S.A. 'They'll return them all right, through channels,' Jackson thought, and put the car in gear. We were sitting in the blind that Wanderobo hunters had built of twigs and branches at the edge of the salt-lick when we heard the motor-lorry coming. At first it was far away and no one could tell what the noise was. Then it was stopped and we hoped it had been nothing or perhaps only the wind. Then it moved slowly nearer, unmistakable now, louder and louder until, agonizing in a clank of loud irregular explosions, it passed close behind us to go on up the road. The theatrical one of the two trackers stood up. â€˜It is finished,â€™ he said. I put my hand to my mouth and motioned him down. â€˜It is finished,â€™ he said again and spread his arms wide. I had never liked him and I liked him less now. â€˜After,â€™ I whispered. Mâ€™Cola shook his head. I looked at his bald black skull and he turned his face a little so that I saw the thin Chinese hairs at the corners of his mouth. â€˜No good,â€™ he said. â€˜Hapana mâ€™uzuri.â€™ â€˜Wait a little,â€™ I told him. He bent his head down again so that it would not show above the dead branches and we sat there in the dust of the hole until it was too dark to see the front sight on my rifle; but nothing more came. The theatrical tracker was impatient and restless. A little before the last of the light was gone he whispered to Mâ€™Cola that it was now too dark to shoot. â€˜Shut up, you,â€™ Mâ€™Cola told him. â€˜The Bwana can shoot after you cannot see.â€™ The other tracker, the educated one, gave another demonstration of his education by scratching his name, Abdullah, on the black skin of his leg with a sharp twig. I watched without admiration and Mâ€™Cola looked at the word without a shadow of expression on his face. After a while the tracker scratched it out. Finally I made a last sight against what was left of the light and saw it was no use, even with the large aperture. Mâ€™Cola was watching. â€˜No good,â€™ I said. â€˜Yes,â€™ he agreed, in Swahili. â€˜Go to camp?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ We stood up and made our way out of the blind and out through the trees, walking on the sandy loam, feeling our way between trees and under branches, back to the road. A mile along the road was the car. As we came alongside, Kamau, the driver, put the lights on. The lorry had spoiled it. That afternoon we had left the car up the road and approached the salt-lick very carefully. There had been a little rain, the day before, though not enough to flood the lick, which was simply an opening in the trees with a patch of earth worn into deep circles and grooved at the edges with hollows where the animals had licked the dirt for salt, and we had seen long, heart-shaped, fresh tracks of four greater kudu bulls that had been on the salt the night before, as well as many newly pressed tracks of lesser kudu. There was also a rhino who, from the tracks and the kicked-up mound of strawy dung, came there each night. The blind had been built at close arrow-shot of the lick, and sitting, leaning back, knees high, heads low, in a hollow half full of ashes and dust, watching through the dried leaves and thin branches I had seen a lesser kudu bull come out of the brush to the edge of the opening where the salt was and stand there, heavy-necked, grey, and handsome, the horns spiralled against the sun while I sighted on his chest and then refused the shot, wanting not to frighten the greater kudu that should surely come at dusk. But before we ever heard the lorry the bull had heard it and run off into the trees, and everything else that had been moving, in the bush on the flats, or coming down from the small hills through the trees, coming toward the salt, had halted at that exploding, clanking sound. They would come, later, in the dark; but then it would be too late. So now, going along the sandy track of the road in the car, the lights picking out the eyes of night birds that squatted close on the sand until the bulk of the car was on them and they rose in soft panic; passing the fires of the travellers that all moved to the westward by day along this road, abandoning the famine country that was ahead of us; me sitting, the butt of my rifle on my foot, the barrel in the crook of my left arm, a flask of whisky between my knees, pouring the whisky into a tin cup and passing it over my shoulder in the dark for Mâ€™Cola to pour water into it from the canteen, drinking this, the first one of the day, the finest one there is, and looking at the thick bush we passed in the dark, feeling the cool wind of the night and smelling the good smell of Africa, I was altogether happy. Then ahead we saw a big fire and as we came up and passed, I made out a lorry beside the road. I told Kamau to stop and go back and as we backed into the firelight there was a short, bandy-legged man with a Tyrolese hat, leather shorts, and an open shirt standing before an unhooded engine in a crowd of natives. â€˜Can we help?â€™ I asked him. â€˜No,â€™ he said. â€˜Unless you are a mechanic. It has taken a dislike to me. All engines dislike me.â€™ â€˜Do you think it could be the timer? It sounded as though it might be a timing knock when you went past us.â€™ â€˜I think it is much worse than that. It sounds to be something very bad.â€™ â€˜If you can get to our camp we have a mechanic.â€™ â€˜How far is it?â€™ â€˜About twenty miles.â€™ â€˜In the morning I will try it. Now I am afraid to make it go farther with that noise of death inside. It is trying to die because it dislikes me. Well, I dislike it too. But if I die it would not annoy it.â€™ â€˜Will you have a drink?â€™ I held out the flask. â€˜Hemingway is my name.â€™ â€˜Kandisky,â€™ he said and bowed. â€˜Hemingway is a name I have heard. Where? Where have I heard it? Oh, yes. The dichter. You know Hemingway the poet?â€™ â€˜Where did you read him?â€™ â€˜In the Querschnitt.â€™ â€˜That is me,â€™ I said, very pleased. The Querschnitt was a German magazine I had written some rather obscene poems for, and published a long story in, years before I could sell anything in America. â€˜This is very strange,â€™ the man in the Tyrolese hat said. â€˜Tell me, what do you think of Ringelnatz?â€™ â€˜He is splendid.â€™ â€˜So. You like Ringelnatz. Good. What do you think of Heinrich Mann?â€™ â€˜He is no good.â€™ â€˜You believe it?â€™ â€˜All I know is that I cannot read him.â€™ â€˜He is no good at all. I see we have things in common. What are you doing here?â€™ â€˜Shooting.â€™ â€˜Not ivory, I hope.â€™ â€˜No. For kudu.â€™ â€˜Why should any man shoot a kudu? You, an intelligent man, a poet, to shoot kudu.â€™ â€˜I havenâ€™t shot any yet,â€™ I said. â€˜But weâ€™ve been hunting them hard now for ten days. We would have got one to-night if it hadnâ€™t been for your lorry.â€™ â€˜That poor lorry. But you should hunt for a year. At the end of that time you have shot everything and you are sorry for it. To hunt for one special animal is nonsense. Why do you do it?â€™ â€˜I like to do it.â€™ â€˜Of course, if you like to do it. Tell me, what do you really think of Rilke?â€™ â€˜I have read only the one thing.â€™ â€˜Which?â€™ â€˜The Cornet.â€™ â€˜You liked it?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜I have no patience with it. It is snobbery. ValÃ©ry, yes. I see the point of ValÃ©ry; although there is much snobbery too. Well at least you do not kill elephants.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™d kill a big enough one.â€™ â€˜How big?â€™ â€˜A seventy-pounder. Maybe smaller.â€™ â€˜I see there are things we do not agree on. But it is a pleasure to meet one of the great old Querschnitt group. Tell me what is Joyce like? I have not the money to buy it. Sinclair Lewis is nothing. I bought it. No. No. Tell me to-morrow. You do not mind if I am camped near? You are with friends? You have a white hunter?â€™ â€˜With my wife. We would be delighted. Yes, a white hunter.â€™ â€˜Why is he not out with you?â€™ â€˜He believes you should hunt kudu alone.â€™ â€˜It is better not to hunt them at all. What is he? English?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜Bloody English?â€™ â€˜No. Very nice. You will like him.â€™ â€˜You must go. I must not keep you. Perhaps I will see you to-morrow. It was very strange that we should meet.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ I said. â€˜Have them look at the lorry to-morrow. Anything we can do?â€™ â€˜Good night,â€™ he said. â€˜Good trip.â€™ â€˜Good night,â€™ I said. We started off and I saw him walking toward the fire waving an arm at the natives. I had not asked him why he had twenty up-country natives with him, nor where he was going. Looking back, I had asked him nothing. I do not like to ask questions, and where I was brought up it was not polite. But here we had not seen a white man for two weeks, not since we had left Babati to go south, and then to run into one on this road where you met only an occasional Indian trader and the steady migration of the natives out of the famine country, to have him look like a caricature of Benchley in Tyrolean costume, to have him know your name, to call you a poet, to have read the Querschnitt, to be an admirer of Joachim Ringelnatz and to want to talk about Rilke, was too fantastic to deal with. So, just then, to crown this fantasy, the lights of the car showed three tall, conical, mounds of something smoking in the road ahead. I motioned to Kamau to stop, and putting on the brakes we skidded just short of them. They were from two to three feet high and when I touched one it was quite warm. â€˜Tembo,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said. It was dung from elephants that had just crossed the road, and in the cold of the evening you could see it steaming. In a little while we were in camp. Next morning I was up and away to another salt-lick before daylight. There was a kudu bull on the lick when we approached through the trees and he gave a loud bark, like a dogâ€™s but higher in pitch and sharply throaty, and was gone, making no noise at first, then crashing in the brush when he was well away; and we never saw him. This lick had an impossible approach. Trees grew around its open area so that it was as though the game were in the blind and you had to come to them across the open. The only way to make it would have been for one man to go alone and crawl and then it would be impossible to get any sort of a close shot through the interlacing trees until you were within twenty yards. Of course once you were inside the protecting trees, and in the blind, you were wonderfully placed, for anything that came to the salt had to come out in the open twenty-five yards from any cover. But though we stayed until eleven oâ€™clock nothing came. We smoothed the dust of the lick carefully with our feet so that any new tracks would show when we came back again and walked the two miles to the road. Being hunted, the game had learned to come only at night and leave before daylight. One bull had stayed and our spooking him that morning would make it even more difficult now. This was the tenth day we had been hunting greater kudu and I had not seen a mature bull yet. We had only three days more because the rains were moving north each day from Rhodesia and unless we were prepared to stay where we were through the rains we must be out as far as Handeni before they came. We had set February 17th as the last safe date to leave. Every morning now it took the heavy, woolly sky an hour or so longer to clear and you could feel the rains coming, as they moved steadily north, as surely as though you watched them on a chart. Now it is pleasant to hunt something that you want very much over a long period of time, being outwitted, out-manÅ“uvred, and failing at the end of each day, but having the hunt and knowing every time you are out that, sooner or later, your luck will change and that you will get the chance that you are seeking. But it is not pleasant to have a time limit by which you must get your kudu or perhaps never get it, nor even see one. It is not the way hunting should be. It is too much like those boys who used to be sent to Paris with two years in which to make good as writers or painters, after which, if they had not made good, they could go home and into their fathersâ€™ businesses. The way to hunt is for as long as you live against as long as there is such and such an animal; just as the way to paint is as long as there is you and colours and canvas, and to write as long as you can live and there is pencil and paper or ink or any machine to do it with, or anything you care to write about, and you feel a fool, and you are a fool, to do it any other way. But here we were, now, caught by time, by the season, and by the running out of our money, so that what should have been as much fun to do each day whether you killed or not was being forced into that most exciting perversion of life; the necessity of accomplishing something in less time than should truly be allowed for its doing. So, coming in at noon, up since two hours before daylight, with only three days left, I was starting to be nervous about it, and there, at the table under the dining tent fly, talking away, was Kandisky of the Tyrolese pants. I had forgotten all about him. â€˜Hello. Hello,â€™ he said. â€˜No success? Nothing doing? Where is the kudu?â€™ â€˜He coughed once and went away,â€™ I said. â€˜Hello, girl.â€™ She smiled. She was worried too. The two of them had been listening since daylight for a shot. Listening all the time, even when our guest had arrived; listening while writing letters, listening while reading, listening when Kandisky came back and talked. â€˜You did not shoot him?â€™ â€˜No. Nor see him.â€™ I saw that Pop was worried too, and a little nervous. There had evidently been considerable talking going on. â€˜Have a beer, Colonel,â€™ he said to me. â€˜We spooked one,â€™ I reported. â€˜No chance of a shot. There were plenty of tracks. Nothing more came. The wind was blowing around. Ask the boys about it.â€™ â€˜As I was telling Colonel Phillips,â€™ Kandisky began, shifting his leather-breeched behind and crossing one heavy-calved, well-haired, bare leg over the other, â€˜you must not stay here too long. You must realize the rains are coming. There is one stretch of twelve miles beyond here you can never get through if it rains. It is impossible.â€™ â€˜So heâ€™s been telling me,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Iâ€™m a Mister, by the way. We use these military titles as nicknames. No offence if youâ€™re a colonel yourself.â€™ Then to me, â€˜Damn these salt-licks. If youâ€™d leave them alone youâ€™d get one.â€™ â€˜They ball it all up,â€™ I agreed. â€˜Youâ€™re so sure of a shot sooner or later on the lick.â€™ â€˜Hunt the hills too.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ll hunt them, Pop.â€™ â€˜What is killing a kudu, anyway?â€™ Kandisky asked. â€˜You should not take it so seriously. It is nothing. In a year you kill twenty.â€™ â€˜Best not say anything about that to the game department, though,â€™ Pop said. â€˜You misunderstand,â€™ Kandisky said. â€˜I mean in a year a man could. Of course no man would wish to.â€™ â€˜Absolutely,â€™ Pop said. â€˜If he lived in kudu country, he could. Theyâ€™re the commonest big antelope in this bush country. Itâ€™s just that when you want to see them you donâ€™t.â€™ â€˜I kill nothing, you understand,â€™ Kandisky told us. â€˜Why are you not more interested in the natives?â€™ â€˜We are,â€™ my wife assured him. â€˜They are really interesting. Listen ...â€™ Kandisky said, and he spoke on to her. â€˜The hell of it is,â€™ I said to Pop, â€˜when Iâ€™m in the hills Iâ€™m sure the bastards are down there on the salt. The cows are in the hills but I donâ€™t believe the bulls are with them now. Then you get there in the evening and there are the tracks. They have been on the lousy salt. I think they come any time.â€™ â€˜Probably they do.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m sure we get different bulls there. They probably only come to the salt every couple of days. Some are certainly spooked because Karl shot that one. If heâ€™d only killed it clean instead of following it through the whole damn countryside. Christ, if heâ€™d only kill any damn thing clean. Other new ones will come in. All we have to do is to wait them out, though. Of course they canâ€™t all know about it. But heâ€™s spooked this country to hell.â€™ â€˜He gets so very excited,â€™ Pop said. â€˜But heâ€™s a good lad. He made a beautiful shot on that leopard, you know. You donâ€™t want them killed any cleaner than that. Let it quiet down again.â€™ â€˜Sure. I donâ€™t mean anything when I curse him.â€™ â€˜What about staying in the blind all day?â€™ â€˜The damned wind started to go round in a circle. It blew our scent every direction. No use to sit there broadcasting it. If the damn wind would hold. Abdullah took an ash can to-day.â€™ â€˜I saw him starting off with it.â€™ There wasnâ€™t a bit of wind when we stalked the salt and there was just light to shoot. He tried the wind with the ashes all the way. I went alone with Abdullah and left the others behind and we went quietly. I had on these crÃªpe-soled boots and itâ€™s soft cotton dirt. The bastard spooked at fifty yards. â€˜Did you ever see their ears?â€™ â€˜Did I ever see their ears? If I can see his ears, the skinner can work on him.â€™ â€˜Theyâ€™re bastards,â€™ Pop said. â€˜I hate this salt-lick business. Theyâ€™re not as smart as we think. The trouble is youâ€™re working on them where they are smart. Theyâ€™ve been shot at there ever since thereâ€™s been salt.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s what makes it fun,â€™ I said. â€˜Iâ€™d be glad to do it for a month. I like to hunt sitting on my tail. No sweat. No nothing. Sit there and catch flies and feed them to the ant lions in the dust. I like it. But what about the time?â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s it. The time.â€™ â€˜So,â€™ Kandisky was saying to my wife. â€˜That is what you should see. The big ngomas. The big native dance festivals. The real ones.â€™ â€˜Listen,â€™ I said to Pop. â€˜The other lick, the one I was at last night, is fool-proof except for being near that bloody road.â€™ â€˜The trackers say it is really the property of the lesser kudu. Itâ€™s a long way too. Itâ€™s eighty miles there and back.â€™ â€˜I know. But there were four big bull tracks. Itâ€™s certain. If it wasnâ€™t for that lorry last night. What about staying there to-night! Then Iâ€™d get the night and the early morning and give this lick a rest. Thereâ€™s a big rhino there too. Big track, anyway.â€™ â€˜Good,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Shoot the rhino too.â€™ He hated to have anything killed except what we were after, no killing on the side, no ornamental killing, no killing to kill, only when you wanted it more than you wanted not to kill it, only when getting it was necessary to his being first in his trade, and I saw he was offering up the rhino to please me. â€˜I wonâ€™t kill him unless heâ€™s good,â€™ I promised. â€˜Shoot the bastard,â€™ Pop said, making a gift of him. â€˜Ah, Pop,â€™ I said. â€˜Shoot him,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Youâ€™ll enjoy it, being by yourself. You can sell the horn if you donâ€™t want it. Youâ€™ve still one on your licence.â€™ â€˜So,â€™ said Kandisky. â€˜You have arranged a plan of campaign? You have decided on how to outwit the poor animals?â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ I said. â€˜How is the lorry?â€™ â€˜That lorry is finished,â€™ the Austrian said. â€˜In a way I am glad. It was too much of a symbol. It was all that remained of my shamba. Now everything is gone and it is much simpler.â€™ â€˜What is a shamba?â€™ asked P.O.M., my wife. â€˜Iâ€™ve been hearing about them for months. Iâ€™m afraid to ask about those words every one uses.â€™ â€˜A plantation,â€™ he said. â€˜It is all gone except that lorry. With the lorry I carry labourers to the shamba of an Indian. It is a very rich Indian who raises sisal. I am a manager for this Indian. An Indian can make a profit from a sisal shamba.â€™ â€˜From anything,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Yes. Where we fail, where we would starve, he makes money. This Indian is very intelligent, however. He values me. I represent European organization. I come now from organizing recruitment of the natives. This takes time. It is impressive. I have been away from my family for three months. The organization is organized. You do it in a week as easily, but it is not so impressive.â€™ â€˜And your wife?â€™ asked mine. â€˜She waits at my house, the house of the manager, with my daughter.â€™ â€˜Does she love you very much?â€™ my wife asked. â€˜She must, or she would be gone long ago.â€™ â€˜How old is the daughter?â€™ â€˜She is thirteen now.â€™ â€˜It must be very nice to have a daughter.â€™ â€˜You cannot know how nice it is. It is like a second wife. My wife knows now all I think, all I say, all I believe, all I can do, all that I cannot do and cannot be. I know also about my wifeâ€”completely. But now there is always someone you do not know, who does not know you, who loves you in ignorance and is strange to you both. Some one very attractive that is yours and not yours and that makes the conversation moreâ€”how shall I say? Yes, it is likeâ€”what do you callâ€”having here with youâ€”with the two of youâ€”yes thereâ€”it is the Heinz Tomato Ketchup on the daily food.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s very good,â€™ I said. â€˜We have books,â€™ he said. â€˜I cannot buy new books now but we can always talk. Ideas and conversation are very interesting. We discuss all things. Everything. We have a very interesting mental life. Formerly, with the shamba, we had the Querschnitt. That gave you a feeling of belonging, of being made a part of, to a very brilliant group of people. The people one would see if one saw whom one wished to see. You know all of those people? You must know them.â€™ â€˜Some of them.â€™ I said. â€˜Some in Paris. Some in Berlin.â€™ I did not wish to destroy anything this man had, and so I did not go into those brilliant people in detail. â€˜Theyâ€™re marvellous,â€™ I said, lying. â€˜I envy you to know them,â€™ he said. â€˜And tell me, who is the greatest writer in America?â€™ â€˜My husband,â€™ said my wife. â€˜No. I do not mean for you to speak from family pride. I mean who really? Certainly not Upton Sinclair. Certainly not Sinclair Lewis. Who is your Thomas Mann? Who is your ValÃ©ry?â€™ â€˜We do not have great writers,â€™ I said. â€˜Something happens to our good writers at a certain age. I can explain but it is quite long and may bore you.â€™ â€˜Please explain,â€™ he said. â€˜This is what I enjoy. This is the best part of life. The life of the mind. This is not killing kudu.â€™ â€˜You havenâ€™t heard it yet,â€™ I said. â€˜Ah, but I can see it coming. You must take more beer to loosen your tongue.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s loose,â€™ I told him. â€˜Itâ€™s always too loose. But you donâ€™t drink anything.â€™ â€˜No, I never drink. It is not good for the mind. It is unnecessary. But tell me. Please tell me.â€™ â€˜Well,â€™ I said, â€˜we have had, in America, skilful writers. Poe is a skilful writer. It is skilful, marvellously constructed, and it is dead. We have had writers of rhetoric who had the good fortune to find a little, in a chronicle of another man and from voyaging, of how things, actual things, can be, whales for instance, and this knowledge is wrapped in the rhetoric like plums in a pudding. Occasionally it is there, alone, unwrapped in pudding, and it is good. This is Melville. But the people who praise it, praise it for the rhetoric which is not important. They put a mystery in which is not there.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ he said. â€˜I see. But it is the mind working, its ability to work, which makes the rhetoric. Rhetoric is the blue sparks from the dynamo.â€™ â€˜Sometimes. And sometimes it is only blue sparks, and what is the dynamo driving?â€™ â€˜So. Go on.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ve forgotten.â€™ â€˜No. Go on. Do not pretend to be stupid.â€™ â€˜Did you ever get up before daylight ...â€™ â€˜Every morning,â€™ he said. â€˜Go on.â€™ â€˜All right. There were others who wrote like exiled English colonials from an England of which they were never a part to a newer England that they were making. Very good men with the small, dried, and excellent wisdom of Unitarians; men of letters; Quakers with a sense of humour.â€™ â€˜Who were these?â€™ â€˜Emerson, Hawthorne, Whittier, and Company. All our early classics who did not know that a new classic does not bear any resemblance to the classics that have preceded it. It can steal from anything that it is better than, anything that is not a classic, all classics do that. Some writers are only born to help another writer to write one sentence. But it cannot derive from or resemble a previous classic. Also all these men were gentlemen, or wished to be. They were all very respectable. They did not use the words that people always have used in speech, the words that survive in language. Nor would you gather that they had bodies. They had minds, yes. Nice, dry, clean minds. This is all very dull, I would not state it except that you ask for it.â€™ â€˜Go on.â€™ â€˜There is one at that time that is supposed to be really good. Thoreau. I cannot tell you about it because I have not yet been able to read it. But that means nothing because I cannot read other naturalists unless they are being extremely accurate and not literary. Naturalists should all work alone and some one else should correlate their findings for them. Writers should work alone. They should see each other only after their work is done, and not too often then. Otherwise they become like writers in New York. All angleworms in a bottle, trying to derive knowledge and nourishment from their own contact and from the bottle. Sometimes the bottle is shaped art, sometimes economics, sometimes economic-religion. But once they are in the bottle they stay there. They are lonesome outside of the bottle. They do not want to be lonesome. They are afraid to be alone in their beliefs and no woman would love any of them enough so that they could kill their lonesomeness in that woman, or pool it with hers, or make something with her that makes the rest unimportant.â€™ â€˜But what about Thoreau?â€™ â€˜Youâ€™ll have to read him. Maybe Iâ€™ll be able to later. I can do nearly everything later.â€™ â€˜Better have some more beer, Papa.â€™ â€˜All right.â€™ â€˜What about the good writers?â€™ â€˜The good writers are Henry James, Stephen Crane, and Mark Twain. Thatâ€™s not the order theyâ€™re good in. There is no order for good writers.â€™ â€˜Mark Twain is a humorist. The others I do not know.â€™ â€˜All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn. If you read it you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys. That is the real end. The rest is just cheating. But itâ€™s the best book weâ€™ve had. All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.â€™ â€˜What about the others?â€™ â€˜Crane wrote two fine stories. The Open Boat and The Blue Hotel. The last one is the better.â€™ â€˜And what happened to him?â€™ â€˜He died. Thatâ€™s simple. He was dying from the start.â€™ â€˜But the other two?â€™ â€˜They both lived to be old men but they did not get any wiser as they got older. I donâ€™t know what they really wanted. You see we make our writers into something very strange.â€™ â€˜I do not understand.â€™ â€˜We destroy them in many ways. First, economically. They make money. It is only by hazard that a writer makes money although good books always make money eventually. Then our writers when they have made some money increase their standard of living and they are caught. They have to write to keep up their establishments, their wives, and so on, and they write slop. It is slop not on purpose but because it is hurried. Because they write when there is nothing to say or no water in the well. Because they are ambitious. Then, once they have betrayed themselves, they justify it and you get more slop. Or else they read the critics. If they believe the critics when they say they are great then they must believe them when they say they are rotten and they lose confidence. At present we have two good writers who cannot write because they have lost confidence through reading critics. If they wrote, sometimes it would be good and sometimes not so good and sometimes it would be quite bad, but the good would get out. But they have read the critics and they must write masterpieces. The masterpieces the critics said they wrote. They werenâ€™t masterpieces, of course. They were just quite good books. So now they cannot write at all. The critics have made them impotent.â€™ â€˜Who are these writers?â€™ â€˜Their names would mean nothing to you and by now they may have written, become frightened, and be impotent again.â€™ â€˜But what is it that happens to American writers? Be definite.â€™ â€˜I was not here in the old days so I cannot tell you about them, but now there are various things. At a certain age the men writers change into Old Mother Hubbard. The women writers become Joan of Arc without the fighting. They become leaders. It doesnâ€™t matter who they lead. If they do not have followers they invent them. It is useless for those selected as followers to protest. They are accused of disloyalty. Oh, hell. There are too many things happen to them. That is one thing. The others try to save their souls with what they write. That is an easy way out. Others are ruined by the first money, the first praise, the first attack, the first time they find they cannot write, or the first time they cannot do anything else, or else they get frightened and join organizations that do their thinking for them. Or they do not know what they want. Henry James wanted to make money. He never did, of course.â€™ â€˜And you?â€™ â€˜I am interested in other things. I have a good life but I must write because if I do not write a certain amount I do not enjoy the rest of my life.â€™ â€˜And what do you want?â€™ â€˜To write as well as I can and learn as I go along. At the same time I have my life which I enjoy and which is a damned good life.â€™ â€˜Hunting kudu?â€™ â€˜Yes. Hunting kudu and many other things.â€™ â€˜What other things?â€™ â€˜Plenty of other things.â€™ â€˜And you know what you want?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜You really like to do this, what you do now, this silliness of kudu?â€™ â€˜Just as much as I like to be in the Prado.â€™ â€˜One is not better than the other?â€™ â€˜One is as necessary as the other. There are other things, too.â€™ â€˜Naturally. There must be. But this sort of thing means something to you, really?â€™ â€˜Truly.â€™ â€˜And you know what you want?â€™ â€˜Absolutely, and I get it all the time.â€™ â€˜But it takes money.â€™ â€˜I could always make money, and besides I have been very lucky.â€™ â€˜Then you are happy?â€™ â€˜Except when I think of other people.â€™ â€˜Then you think of other people?â€™ â€˜Oh, yes.â€™ â€˜But you do nothing for them?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ â€˜Nothing?â€™ â€˜Maybe a little.â€™ â€˜Do you think your writing is worth doingâ€”as an end in itself?â€™ â€˜Oh, yes.â€™ â€˜You are sure?â€™ â€˜Very sure.â€™ â€˜That must be very pleasant.â€™ â€˜It is,â€™ I said. â€˜It is the one altogether pleasant thing about it.â€™ â€˜This is getting awfully serious,â€™ my wife said. â€˜Itâ€™s a damned serious subject.â€™ â€˜You see, he is really serious about something,â€™ Kandisky said. â€˜I knew he must be serious on something besides kudu.â€™ â€˜The reason everyone now tries to avoid it, to deny that it is important, to make it seem vain to try to do it, is because it is so difficult. Too many factors must combine to make it possible.â€™ â€˜What is this now?â€™ â€˜The kind of writing that can be done. How far prose can be carried if anyone is serious enough and has luck. There is a fourth and fifth dimension that can be gotten.â€™ â€˜You believe it?â€™ â€˜I know it.â€™ â€˜And if a writer can get this?â€™ â€˜Then nothing else matters. It is more important than anything he can do. The chances are, of course, that he will fail. But there is a chance that he succeeds.â€™ â€˜But that is poetry you are talking about.â€™ â€˜No. It is much more difficult than poetry. It is a prose that has never been written. But it can be written, without tricks and without cheating. With nothing that will go bad afterwards.â€™ â€˜And why has it not been written?â€™ â€˜Because there are too many factors. First, there must be talent, much talent. Talent such as Kipling had. Then there must be discipline. The discipline of Flaubert. Then there must be the conception of what it can be and an absolute conscience as unchanging as the standard meter in Paris, to prevent faking. Then the writer must be intelligent and disinterested and above all he must survive. Try to get all these in one person and have him come through all the influences that press on a writer. The hardest thing, because time is so short, is for him to survive and get his work done. But I would like us to have such a writer and to read what he would write. What do you say? Should we talk about something else?â€™ â€˜It is interesting what you say. Naturally I do not agree with everything.â€™ â€˜Naturally.â€™ â€˜What about a gimlet?â€™ Pop asked. â€˜Donâ€™t you think a gimlet might help?â€™ â€˜Tell me first what are the things, the actual, concrete things that harm a writer?â€™ I was tired of the conversation which was becoming an interview. So I would make it an interview and finish it. The necessity to put a thousand intangibles into a sentence, now, before lunch, was too bloody. â€˜Politics, women, drink, money, ambition. And the lack of politics, women, drink, money and ambition,â€™ I said profoundly. â€˜Heâ€™s getting much too easy now,â€™ Pop said. â€˜But drink. I do not understand about that. That has always seemed silly to me. I understand it as a weakness.â€™ â€˜It is a way of ending a day. It has great benefits. Donâ€™t you ever want to change your ideas?â€™ â€˜Letâ€™s have one,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Mâ€™Wendi!â€™ Pop never drank before lunch except as a mistake and I knew he was trying to help me out. â€˜Letâ€™s all have a gimlet,â€™ I said. â€˜I never drink,â€™ Kandisky said. â€˜I will go to the lorry and fetch some fresh butter for lunch. It is fresh from Kandoa, unsalted. Very good. To-night we will have a special dish of Viennese dessert. My cook has learned to make it very well.â€™ He went off and my wife said: â€˜You were getting awfully profound. What was that about all these women?â€™ â€˜What women?â€™ â€˜When you were talking about women.â€™ â€˜The hell with them,â€™ I said. â€˜Those are the ones you get involved with when youâ€™re drunk.â€™ â€˜So thatâ€™s what you do.â€™ â€˜No.â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t get involved with people when Iâ€™m drunk.â€™ â€˜Come, come,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Weâ€™re none of us ever drunk. My God, that man can talk.â€™ â€˜He didnâ€™t have a chance to talk after Bâ€™wana Mâ€™Kumba started.â€™ â€˜I did have verbal dysentery,â€™ I said. â€˜What about his lorry? Can we tow it in without ruining ours?â€™ â€˜I think so,â€™ Pop said. â€˜When ours comes back from Handeni.â€™ At lunch under the green fly of the dining-tent, in the shade of a big tree, the wind blowing, the fresh butter much admired, Grantâ€™s gazelle chops, mashed potatoes, green corn, and then mixed fruit for dessert, Kandisky told us why the East Indians were taking the country over. â€˜You see, during the war they sent the Indian troops to fight here. To keep them out of India because they feared another mutiny. They promised the Aga Khan that because they fought in Africa, Indians could come freely to settle and for business afterwards. They cannot break that promise and now the Indians have taken the country over from the Europeans. They live on nothing and they send all the money back to India. When they have made enough to go home they leave, bringing out their poor relations to take over from them and continue to exploit the country.â€™ Pop said nothing. He would not argue with a guest at table. â€˜It is the Aga Khan,â€™ Kandisky said. â€˜You are an American. You know nothing of these combinations.â€™ â€˜Were you with Von LettÃ¶w?â€™ Pop asked him. â€˜From the start,â€™ Kandisky said. â€˜Until the end.â€™ â€˜He was a great fighter,â€™ Pop said. â€˜I have great admiration for him.â€™ â€˜You fought?â€™ Kandisky asked. â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜I do not care for LettÃ¶w,â€™ Kandisky said. â€˜He fought, yes. No one ever better. When we wanted quinine he would order it captured. All supplies the same. But afterwards he cared nothing for his men. After the war I am in Germany. I go to see about indemnification for my property. "You are an Austrian," they say. "You must go through Austrian channels." So I go to Austria. "But why did you fight?" they ask me. "You cannot hold us responsible. Suppose you go to fight in China. That is your own affair. We cannot do anything for you." â€˜"But I went as a patriot," I say, very foolishly. "I fight where I can because I am an Austrian and I know my duty." "Yes," they say. "That is very beautiful. But you cannot hold us responsible for your noble sentiments." So they passed me from one to the other and nothing. Still I love the country very much. I have lost everything here but I have more than anyone has in Europe. To me it is always interesting. The natives and the language. I have many books of notes on them. Then too, in reality, I am a king here. It is very pleasant. Waking in the morning I extend one foot and the boy places the sock on it. When I am ready I extend the other foot and he adjusts the other sock. I step from under the mosquito bar into my drawers which are held for me. Donâ€™t you think that is very marvellous?â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s marvellous.â€™ â€˜When you come back another time we must take a safari to study the natives. And shoot nothing, or only to eat. Look, I will show you a dance and sing a song.â€™ Crouched, elbows lifting and falling, knees humping, he shuffled around the table, singing. Undoubtedly it was very fine. â€˜That is only one of a thousand,â€™ he said. â€˜Now I must go for a time. You will be sleeping.â€™ â€˜Thereâ€™s no hurry. Stay around.â€™ â€˜No. Surely you will be sleeping. I also. I will take the butter to keep it cool.â€™ â€˜Weâ€™ll see you at supper,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Now you must sleep. Good-bye.â€™ After he was gone, Pop said: â€˜I wouldnâ€™t believe all that about the Aga Khan, you know.â€™ â€˜It sounded pretty good.â€™ â€˜Of course he feels badly,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Who wouldnâ€™t. Von LettÃ¶w was a hell of a man.â€™ â€˜Heâ€™s very intelligent,â€™ my wife said. â€˜He talks wonderfully about the natives. But heâ€™s bitter about American women.â€™ â€˜So am I,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Heâ€™s a good man. You better get some shut-eye. Youâ€™ll need to start about three-thirty.â€™ â€˜Have them call me.â€™ Molo raised the back of the tent, propping it with sticks, so the wind blew through and I went to sleep reading, the wind coming in cool and fresh under the heated canvas. When I woke it was time to go. There were rain clouds in the sky and it was very hot. They had packed some tinned fruit, a five-pound piece of roast meat, bread, tea, a tea pot, and some tinned milk in a whisky box with four bottles of beer. There was a canvas water bag and a ground cloth to use as a tent. Mâ€™Cola was taking the big gun out to the car. â€˜Thereâ€™s no hurry about getting back,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Weâ€™ll look for you when we see you.â€™ â€˜All right.â€™ â€˜Weâ€™ll send the lorry to haul that sportsman into Handeni. Heâ€™s sending his men ahead walking.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™re sure the lorry can stand it? Donâ€™t do it because heâ€™s a friend of mine.â€™ â€˜Have to get him out. The lorry will be in to-night.â€™ â€˜The Memsahibâ€™s still asleep,â€™ I said. â€˜Maybe she can get out for a walk and shoot some guineas?â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m here,â€™ she said. â€˜Donâ€™t worry about us. Oh, I hope you get them.â€™ â€˜Donâ€™t send out to look for us along the road until day after to-morrow,â€™ I said. â€˜If thereâ€™s a good chance weâ€™ll stay.â€™ â€˜Good luck.â€™ â€˜Good luck, sweet. Good-bye, Mr. J. P.â€™ CHAPTER TWO We were out from under the shade of camp and along the sandy river of a road, driving into the western sun, the bush thick to the edge of the sand, solid as a thicket, the little hills rising above it, and all along the road we passed groups of people making their way to the westward. Some were naked except for a greasy cloth knotted over one shoulder, and carried bows and sealed quivers of arrows. Others carried spears. The wealthy carried umbrellas and wore draped white cloth and their women walked behind them, with their pots and pans. Bundles and loads of skins were scattered along ahead on the heads of other natives. All were travelling away from the famine. And in the heat, my feet out over the side of the car to keep them away from the heat of the engine, hat low over the eyes against the sun, watching the road, the people, and all clearings in the bush for game, we drove to the westward. Once we saw three lesser kudu cows in an open place of broken bush. Grey, big bellied, long necked, small headed, and with big ears, they moved quickly into the woods and were gone. We left the car and tracked them but there was no bull track. A little beyond there a flock of guineas quick-legged across the road running steady-headed with the motion of trotters. As I jumped from the car and sprinted after them they rocketed up, their legs tucked close beneath them, heavy-bodied, short wings drumming, cackling, to go over the trees ahead. I dropped two that thumped hard when they fell and as they lay, wings beating, Abdullah cut their heads off so they would be legal eating. He put them in the car where Mâ€™Cola sat laughing; his old manâ€™s healthy laugh, his making-fun-of-me laugh, his bird-shooting laugh that dated from a streak of raging misses one time that had delighted him. Now when I killed, it was a joke, as when we shot a hyena; the funniest joke of all. He laughed always to see the birds tumble and when I missed he roared and shook his head again and again. â€˜Ask him what the hell heâ€™s laughing about?â€™ I asked Pop once. â€˜At Bâ€™wana,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said, and shook his head, â€˜at the little birds.â€™ â€˜He thinks youâ€™re funny,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Goddam it. I am funny. But the hell with him.â€™ â€˜He thinks youâ€™re very funny,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Now the Memsahib and I would never laugh.â€™ â€˜Shoot them yourself.â€™ â€˜No, youâ€™re the bird shot. The self-confessed bird shot,â€™ she said. So bird shooting became this marvellous joke. If I killed, the joke was on the birds and Mâ€™Cola would shake his head and laugh and make his hands go round and round to show how the bird turned over in the air. And if I missed, I was the clown of the piece and he would look at me and shake with laughing. Only the hyenas were funnier. Highly humorous was the hyena obscenely loping, full belly dragging, at daylight on the plain, who, shot from the stern, skittered on into speed to tumble end over end. Mirth provoking was the hyena that stopped out of range by an alkali lake to look back and, hit in the chest, went over on his back, his four feet and his full belly in the air. Nothing could be more jolly than the hyena coming suddenly wedge-headed and stinking out of high grass by a donga, hit at ten yards, who raced his tail in three narrowing, scampering circles until he died. It was funny to Mâ€™Cola to see a hyena shot at close range. There was that comic slap of the bullet and the hyenaâ€™s agitated surprise to find death inside of him. It was funnier to see a hyena shot at a great distance, in the heat shimmer of the plain, to see him go over backwards, to see him start that frantic circle, to see that electric speed that meant that he was racing the little nickeled death inside him. But the great joke of all, the thing Mâ€™Cola waved his hands across his face about, and turned away and shook his head and laughed, ashamed even of the hyena; the pinnacle of hyenic humour, was the hyena, the classic hyena, that hit too far back while running, would circle madly, snapping and tearing at himself until he pulled his own intestines out, and then stood there, jerking them out and eating them with relish. â€˜Fisi,â€™ Mâ€™Cola would say and shake his head in delighted sorrow at there being such an awful beast. Fisi, the hyena, hermaphroditic, self-eating devourer of the dead, trailer of calving cows, ham-stringer, potential biter-off of your face at night while you slept, sad yowler, camp-follower, stinking, foul, with jaws that crack the bones the lion leaves, belly dragging, loping away on the brown plain, looking back, mongrel dog-smart in the face; whack from the little Mannlicher and then the horrid circle starting. â€˜Fisi,â€™ Mâ€™Cola laughed, ashamed of him, shaking his bald black head. â€˜Fisi. Eats himself. Fisi.â€™ The hyena was a dirty joke but bird shooting was a clean joke. My whisky was a clean joke. There were many variations of that joke. Some we come to later. The Mohammedans and all religions were a joke. A joke on all the people who had them. Charo, the other gun bearer, was short, very serious and highly religious. All Ramadan he never swallowed his saliva until sunset and when the sun was almost down Iâ€™d see him watching nervously. He had a bottle with him of some sort of tea and he would finger it and watch the sun and I would see Mâ€™Cola watching him and pretending not to see. This was not outrightly funny to him. This was something that he could not laugh about openly but that he felt superior to and wondered at the silliness of it. The Mohammedan religion was very fashionable and all the higher social grades among the boys were Mohammedans. It was something that gave caste, something to believe in, something fashionable and god-giving to suffer a little for each year, something that made you superior to other people, something that gave you more complicated habits of eating, something that I understood and Mâ€™Cola did not understand, nor care about, and he watched Charo watch for the sun to set with that blank look on his face that it put on about all things that he was not a part of. Charo was deadly thirsty and truly devout and the sun set very slowly. I looked at it, red over the trees, nudged him and he grinned. Mâ€™Cola offered me the water bottle solemnly. I shook my head and Charo grinned again. Mâ€™Cola looked blank. Then the sun was down and Charo had the bottle tilted up, his Adamâ€™s apple rising and falling greedily and Mâ€™Cola looking at him and then looking away. In the early days, before we became good friends, he did not trust me at all. When anything came up he went into this blankness. I liked Charo much better then. We understood each other on the question of religion and Charo admired my shooting and always shook hands and smiled when we had killed anything particularly good. This was flattering and pleasing. Mâ€™Cola looked on all this early shooting as a series of lucky accidents. We were supposed to shoot. We had not yet shot anything that amounted to anything and he was not really my gun bearer. He was Mr. Jackson Phillipâ€™s gun bearer and he had been loaned to me. I meant nothing to him. He did not like me nor dislike me. He was politely contemptuous of Karl. Who he liked was Mama. The evening we killed the first lion it was dark when we came in sight of camp. The killing of the lion had the Springfield and it had raked him, going through lungs and heart. I was so surprised by the way he had rolled over dead from the shot after we had been prepared for a charge, for heroics, and for drama, that I felt more let down than pleased. It was our first lion and we were very ignorant and this was not what we had paid to see. Charo and Mâ€™Cola both shook P.O.M.â€™s hand and then Charo came over and shook hands with me. â€˜Good shot, Bâ€™wana,â€™ he said in Swahili. â€™Piga mâ€™uzuri.â€˜ â€˜Did you shoot, Karl?â€™ I asked. â€˜No. I was just going to when you shot.â€™ â€˜You didnâ€™t shoot him, Pop?â€™ â€˜No. Youâ€™d have heard it.â€™ He opened the breech and took out the two big Â·450 No. 2â€™s. â€˜Iâ€™m sure I missed him,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜I was sure you hit him. I still think you hit him,â€™ I said. â€˜Mama hit,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said. â€˜Where?â€™ Charo asked. â€˜Hit,â€™ said Mâ€™Cola. â€˜Hit.â€™ â€˜You rolled him over,â€™ Pop said to me. â€˜God, he went over like a rabbit.â€™ â€˜I couldnâ€™t believe it.â€™ â€˜Mama piga,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said. â€™Piga Simba.â€˜ As we saw the camp fire in the dark ahead of us, coming in that night, Mâ€™Cola suddenly commenced to shout a stream of high-pitched, rapid, singing words in Wakamba ending in the word â€™Simbaâ€˜. Someone at the camp shouted back one word. â€˜Mama!â€™ Mâ€™Cola shouted. Then another long stream. Then â€˜Mama! Mama!â€™ Through the dark came all the porters, the cook, the skinner, the boys, and the headman. â€˜Mama!â€™ Mâ€™Cola shouted. â€˜Mama piga Simba.â€™ The boys came dancing, crowing, and beating time and chanting something from down in their chests that started like a cough and sounded like â€™Hey la Mama! Hay la Mama! Hey la Mama!â€˜ The rolling-eyed skinner picked P.O.M. up, the big cook and the boys held her, and the others pressing forward to lift and if not to lift to touch and hold, they danced and sang through the dark around the fire and to our tent. â€˜Hey la Mama! huh! huh! huh! Hay la Mama! huh! huh! huh!â€™ they sang the lion dance with that deep, lion asthmatic cough in it. Then at the tent they put her down and everyone, very shyly, shook hands, the boys saying â€™mâ€™uzuri, Memsahib,â€™ and Mâ€™Cola and the porters all saying â€™mâ€™uzuri, Mamaâ€™ with much feeling in the accenting of the word â€˜Mamaâ€™. Afterwards in the chairs in front of the fire, sitting with the drinks, Pop said, â€˜You shot it. Mâ€™Cola would kill anyone who said you didnâ€™t.â€™ â€˜You know, I feel as though I did shoot it,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜I donâ€™t believe Iâ€™d be able to stand it if I really had shot it. Iâ€™d be too proud. Isnâ€™t triumph marvellous?â€™ â€˜Good old Mama,â€™ Karl said. â€˜I believe you did shoot him,â€™ I said. â€˜Oh, letâ€™s not go into that,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜I feel so wonderful about just being supposed to have killed him. You know people never used to carry me on their shoulders much at home.â€™ â€˜No one knows how to behave in America,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Most uncivilized.â€™ â€˜Weâ€™ll carry you in Key West,â€™ Karl said. â€˜Poor old Mama.â€™ â€˜Letâ€™s not talk about it,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜I like it too much. Shouldnâ€™t I maybe distribute largess?â€™ â€˜They didnâ€™t do it for that,â€™ Pop said. â€˜But it is all right to give something to celebrate.â€™ â€˜Oh, I want to give them all a great deal of money,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Isnâ€™t triumph simply marvellous?â€™ â€˜Good old Mama,â€™ I said. â€˜You killed him.â€™ â€˜No, I didnâ€™t. Donâ€™t lie to me. Just let me enjoy my triumph.â€™ Anyway Mâ€™Cola did not trust me for a long time. Until P.O.M.â€™s licence ran out, she was his favourite and we were simply a lot of people who interfered and kept Mama from shooting things. Once her licence was out and she was no longer shooting, she dropped back into non-combatant status with him and as we began to hunt kudu and Pop stayed in camp and sent us out alone with the trackers, Karl with Charo and Mâ€™Cola and I together, Mâ€™Cola dropped Pop visibly in his estimation. It was only temporary of course. He was Popâ€™s man and I believe his working estimations were only from day to day and required an unbroken series of events to have any meaning. But something had happened between us. PART II PURSUIT REMEMBERED CHAPTER ONE It dated back to the time of Droopy, after I had come back from being ill in Nairobi and we had gone on a foot safari to hunt rhino in the forest. Droopy was a real savage with lids to his eyes that nearly covered them, handsome, with a great deal of style, a fine hunter and a beautiful tracker. He was about thirty-five, I should think, and wore only a piece of cloth knotted over one shoulder, and a fez that some hunter had given him. He always carried a spear. Mâ€™Cola wore an old U.S. Army khaki tunic, complete with buttons, that had originally been brought out for Droopy, who had been away somewhere and had missed getting it. Twice Pop had brought it out for Droopy and finally Mâ€™Cola had said, â€˜Give it to meâ€™. Pop had let him have it and Mâ€™Cola had worn it ever since. It, a pair of shorts, his fuzzy wool curlerâ€™s cap, and a knitted army sweater he wore when washing the tunic, were the only garments I ever saw on the old man until he took my bird-shooting coat. For shoes he used sandals cut from old motor-car tyres. He had slim, handsome legs with well-turned ankles on the style of Babe Ruthâ€™s and I remember how surprised I was the first time I saw him with the tunic off and noticed how old his upper body was. It had that aged look you see in photographs of Jeffries and Sharkey posing thirty years after, the ugly, old-man biceps and the fallen pectoral muscles. â€˜How old is Mâ€™Cola?â€™ I asked Pop. â€˜He must be over fifty,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Heâ€™s got a grown-up family in the native reserve.â€™ â€˜How are his kids?â€™ â€˜No good, worthless. He canâ€™t handle them. We tried one as a porter. But he was no good.â€™ Mâ€™Cola was not jealous of Droopy. He simply knew that Droopy was a better man than he was. More of a hunter, a faster and a cleaner tracker, and a great stylist in everything he did. He admired Droopy in the same way we did and being out with him, it made him realize that he was wearing Droopyâ€™s tunic and that he had been a porter before he became a gun bearer and suddenly he ceased being an old timer and we were hunting together; he and I hunting together and Droopy in command of the show. That had been a fine hunt. The afternoon of the day we came into the country we walked about four miles from camp along a deep rhino trail that graded through the grassy hills with their abandoned orchard-looking trees, as smoothly and evenly as though an engineer had planned it. The trail was a foot deep in the ground and smoothly worn and we left it where it slanted down through a divide in the hills like a dry irrigation ditch and climbed, sweating, the small, steep hill on the right to sit there with our backs against the hilltop and glass the country. It was a green, pleasant country, with hills below the forest that grew thick on the side of a mountain, and it was cut by the valleys of several watercourses that came down out of the thick timber on the mountain. Fingers of the forest came down on to the head of some of the slopes and it was there, at the forest edge, that we watched for rhino to come out. If you looked away from the forest and the mountain side you could follow the watercourses and the hilly slope of the land down until the land flattened and the grass was brown and burned and, away, across a long sweep of country, was the brown Rift Valley and the shine of Lake Manyara. We all lay there on the hillside and watched the country carefully for rhino. Droopy was on the other side of the hilltop, squatted on his heels, looking, and Mâ€™Cola sat below us. There was a cool breeze from the east and it blew the grass in waves on the hillsides. There were many large white clouds and the tall trees of the forest on the mountain side grew so closely and were so foliaged that it looked as though you could walk on their tops. Behind this mountain there was a gap and then another mountain and the far mountain was dark blue with forest in the distance. Until five oâ€™clock we did not see anything. Then, without the glasses, I saw something moving over the shoulder of one of the valleys toward a strip of the timber. In the glasses it was a rhino, showing very clear and minute at the distance, red-coloured in the sun, moving with a quick waterbug-like motion across the hill. Then there were three more of them that came out of the forest, dark in the shadow, and two that fought, tinily, in the glasses, pushing head-on, fighting in front of a clump of bushes while we watched them and the light failed. It was too dark to get down the hill, across the valley and up the narrow slope of mountain side to them in time for a shot. So we went back to the camp, down the hill in the dark, edging down on our shoes and then feeling the trail smooth under foot, walking along that deep trail, that wound through the dark hills, until we saw the firelight in the trees. We were excited that night because we had seen the three rhino and early the next morning while we were eating breakfast before starting out, Droopy came in to report a herd of buffalo he had found feeding at the edge of the forest not two miles from camp. We went there, still tasting coffee and kippers in the early morning heart-pounding of excitement, and the native Droopy had left watching them pointed where they had crossed a deep gulch and gone into an open patch of forest. He said there were two big bulls in a herd of a dozen or more. We followed them in, moving very quietly on the game trails, pushing the vines aside and seeing the tracks and the quantities of fresh dung, but though we went on into the forest, where it was too thick to shoot and made a wide circle, we did not see or hear them. Once we heard the tick birds and saw them flying, but that was all. There were numbers of rhino trails there in the woods and many strawy piles of dung, but we saw nothing but the green wood-pigeons and some monkeys, and when we came out we were wet to our waists from the dew, and the sun was quite high. The day was very hot, now before the wind had gotten up, and we knew whatever rhino and buffalo had been out would have gone back deep into the forest to rest out of the heat. The others started back to camp with Pop and Mâ€™Cola. There was no meat in camp, and I wanted to hunt back in a circle with Droopy to see if we could kill a piece. I was beginning to feel strong again after the dysentery and it was a pleasure to walk in the easy rolling country, simply to walk, and to be able to hunt, not knowing what we might see and free to shoot for the meat we needed. Then, too, I liked Droopy and liked to watch him walk. He strode very loosely and with a slight lift, and I liked to watch him and to feel the grass under my soft-soled boots and the pleasant weight of the rifle, held just back of the muzzle, the barrel resting on my shoulder, and the sun hot enough to sweat you well as it burned the dew from the grass; with the breeze starting and the country like an abandoned New England orchard to walk through. I knew that I was shooting well again and I wanted to make a shot to impress Droopy. From the top of one rise we saw two kongoni showing yellow on a hillside about a mile away and I motioned to Droop that we would go after them. We started down and in a ravine jumped a waterbuck bull and two cows. Waterbuck was the one animal we might get that I knew was worthless as meat and I had shot a better head than this one carried. I had the sights on the buck as he tore away, remembered about the worthless meat, and having the head, and did not shoot. â€˜No shoot kuro?â€™ Droopy asked in Swahili. â€™Doumi sana. A good bull.â€™ I tried to tell him that I had a better one and that it was no good to eat. He grinned. â€˜Piga kongoni mâ€™uzuri.â€™ â€˜Pigaâ€™ was a fine word. It sounded exactly as the command to fire should sound or the announcement of a hit. â€˜Mâ€™uzuriâ€™, meaning good, well, better, had sounded too much like the name of a state for a long time, and walking I used to make up sentences in Swahili with Arkansas and Mâ€™usuri in them, but now it seemed natural, no longer to be italicized, just as all the words came to seem the proper and natural words and there was nothing odd or unseemly in the stretching of the ears, in the tribal scars, or in a man carrying a spear. The tribal marks and the tattooed places seemed natural and handsome adornments and I regretted not having any of my own. My own scars were all informal, some irregular and sprawling, others simply puffy welts. I had one on my forehead that people still commented on, asking if I had bumped my head; but Droop had handsome ones beside his cheekbones and others, symmetrical and decorative, on his chest and belly. I was thinking that I had one good one, a sort of embossed Christmas tree, on the bottom of my right foot that only served to wear out socks, when we jumped two reedbuck. They went off through the trees and then stood at sixty yards, the thin, graceful buck looking back, and I shot him high and a touch behind the shoulder. He gave a jump and went off very fast. â€˜Piga.â€™ Droopy smiled. We had both heard the whunk of the bullet. â€˜Kufa,â€™ I told him. â€˜Dead.â€™ But when we came up to him, lying on his side, his heart was still beating strongly, although to all appearances he was dead. Droopy had no skinning knife and I had only a penknife to stick him with. I felt for the heart behind the foreleg with my fingers and feeling it beating under the hide slipped the knife in but it was short and pushed the heart away. I could feel it, hot and rubbery against my fingers, and feel the knife push it, but I felt around and cut the big artery and the blood came hot against my fingers. Once bled, I started to open him, with the little knife, still showing off to Droopy, and emptying him neatly took out the liver, cut away the gall, and laying the liver on a hummock of grass, put the kidneys beside it. Droopy asked for the knife. Now he was going to show me something. Skilfully he slit open the stomach and turned it inside, tripe side, out, emptying the grass in it on the ground, shook it, then put the liver and kidneys inside it and with the knife cut a switch from the tree the buck lay under and sewed the stomach together with the withe so that the tripe made a bag to carry the other delicacies in. Then he cut a pole and put the bag on the end of it, running it through the flaps, and put it over his shoulder in the way tramps carried their property in a handkerchief on the end of a stick in Blue Jay corn plaster advertisements when we were children. It was a good trick and I thought how I would show it to John Staib in Wyoming some time and he would smile his deaf manâ€™s smile (you had to throw pebbles at him to make him stop when you heard a bull bugle), and I knew what John would say. He would say, â€˜By Godd, Urnust, dotâ€™s smardtâ€™. Droop handed me the stick, then took off his single garment, made a sling and got the buck up on his back. I tried to help him and suggested by signs that we cut a pole and sling him, carrying him between us, but he wanted to carry him alone. So we started for camp, me with the tripe bag on the end of a stick over my shoulder, my rifle slung, and Droopy staggering steadily ahead, sweating heavily, under the buck. I tried to get him to hang him in a tree and leave him until we could send out a couple of porters, and to that end we put him in the crotch of a tree. But when Droopy saw that I meant to go off and leave him there rather than simply allow him to drain he got him down on to his shoulders again and we went on into camp, the boys, around the cooking fire, all laughing at the tripe bag over my shoulder as we came in. This was the kind of hunting that I liked. No riding in cars, the country broken up instead of the plains, and I was completely happy. I had been quite ill and had that pleasant feeling of getting stronger each day. I was underweight, had a great appetite for meat, and could eat all I wanted without feeling stuffy. Each day I sweated out whatever we drank sitting at the fire at night, and in the heat of the day, now, I lay in the shade with a breeze in the trees and read with no obligation and no compulsion to write, happy in knowing that at four oâ€™clock we would be starting out to hunt again. I would not even write a letter. The only person I really cared about, except the children, was with me, and I had no wish to share this life with anyone who was not there, only to live it, being completely happy and quite tired. I knew that I was shooting well and I had that feeling of well-being and confidence that is so much more pleasant to have than to hear about. As it turned out, we started soon after three to be on the hill by four. But it was nearly five before we saw the first rhino come bustling short-leggedly across the ridge of hill in almost the same place we had seen the rhino the night before. We sat where he went into the edge of the forest near where we had seen the two fighting and then took a course that would lead us down the hill, across the grown-over gully at the bottom, and up the steep slope to where there was a thorn tree with yellow blossoms that marked the place where we had seen the rhino go in. Coming straight up the slope in sight of the thorn tree, the wind blowing across the hill, I tried to walk as slowly as I could and put a handkerchief inside the sweatband of my hat to keep the perspiration out of my glasses. I expected to shoot at any minute and I wanted to slow up enough so my heart would not be pounding. In shooting large animals there is no reason ever to miss if you have a clear shot and can shoot and know where to shoot, unless you are unsteady from a run or a climb or fog your glasses, break them or run out of cloth or paper to wipe them clean. The glasses were the biggest hazard and I used to carry four handkerchiefs and change them from the left to the right pocket when they were wet. We came up to the yellow blossomed tree very carefully, like people walking up to a bevy of quail the dogs have pointed, and the rhino was not in sight. We went all through the edge of the forest and it was full of tracks and fresh rhino sign, but there was no rhino. The sun was setting and it was getting too dark to shoot, but we followed the forest around the side of the mountain, hoping to see a rhino in the open glades. When it was almost too dark to shoot, I saw Droopy stop and crouch. With his head down he motioned us forward. Crawling up, we saw a large rhino and a small one standing chest deep in brush, facing us across a little valley. â€˜Cow and calf,â€™ Pop said softly. â€˜Canâ€™t shoot her. Let me look at her horn.â€™ He took the glasses from Mâ€™Cola. â€˜Can she see us?â€™ P.O.M. asked. â€˜No.â€™ â€˜How far are they?â€™ â€˜Must be nearly five hundred yards.â€™ â€˜My God, she looks big,â€™ I whispered. â€˜Sheâ€™s a big cow,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Wonder what became of the bull?â€™ He was pleased and excited by the sight of game. â€˜Too dark to shoot unless weâ€™re right on him.â€™ The rhinos had turned and were feeding. They never seemed to move slowly. They either bustled or stood still. â€˜What makes them so red?â€™ P.O.M. asked. â€˜Rolling in the mud,â€™ Pop answered. â€˜We better get along while thereâ€™s light.â€™ The sun was down when we came out of the forest and looked down the slope and across to the hill where we had watched from with our glasses. We should have back-tracked and gone down, crossed the gulch, and climbed back up the trail the way we had come, but we decided, like fools, to grade straight across the mountainside below the edge of the forest. So in the dark, following this ideal line, we descended into steep ravines that showed only as wooded patches until you were in them, slid down, clung to vines, stumbled and climbed and slid again, down and down, then steeply, impossibly, up, hearing the rustle of night things and the cough of a leopard hunting baboons; me scared of snakes, and touching each root and branch with snake fear in the dark. To go down and up two hands-and-knee climbing ravines and then out into the moonlight and the long, too-steep shoulder of mountain that you climbed one foot up to the other, one foot after the other, one stride at a time, leaning forward against the grade and the altitude, dead tired and gun weary, single file in the moonlight across the slope, on up and to the top where it was easy, the country spread in the moonlight, then up and down and on, through the small hills, tired but now in sight of the fires and on into camp. So then you sit, bundled against the evening chill, at the fire, with a whisky and soda, waiting for the announcement that the canvas bath had been a quarter filled with hot water. â€˜Bathi, Bâ€™wana.â€™ â€˜Goddamn it, I could never hunt sheep again,â€™ you say. â€˜I never could,â€™ says P.O.M. â€˜You all made me.â€™ â€˜You climbed better than any of us.â€™ â€˜Do you suppose we could hunt sheep again, Pop?â€™ â€˜I wonder,â€™ Pop said. â€˜I suppose itâ€™s merely condition.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s riding in the damned cars that ruins us.â€™ â€˜If we did that walk every night we could come back in three nights from now and never feel it.â€™ â€˜Yes. But Iâ€™d be as scared of snakes if we did it every night for a year.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™d get over it.â€™ â€˜No,â€™ I said. â€˜They scare me stiff. Do you remember that time we touched hands behind the tree?â€™ â€˜Rather,â€™ said Pop. â€˜You jumped two yards. Are you really afraid of them, or only talking?â€™ â€˜They scare me sick,â€™ I said. â€˜They always have.â€™ â€˜Whatâ€™s the matter with you men?â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Why havenâ€™t I heard anything about the war to-night?â€™ â€˜Weâ€™re too tired. Were you in the war, Pop?â€™ â€˜Not me,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Where is that boy with the whisky?â€™ Then calling in that feeble, clowning falsetto, â€˜Kayti . . . Katy-ay!â€™ â€˜Bathi,â€™ said Molo again softly, but insistently. â€˜Too tired.â€™ â€˜Memsahib bathi,â€™ Molo said hopefully. â€˜Iâ€™ll go,â€™ said P.O.M. â€˜But you two hurry up with your drinking. Iâ€™m hungry.â€™ â€˜Bathi,â€™ said Kayti severely to Pop. â€˜Bathi yourself,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Donâ€™t bully me.â€™ Kayti turned away in fire-lit slanting smile. â€˜All right. All right,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Going to have one?â€™ he asked. â€˜Weâ€™ll have just one,â€™ I said, â€˜and then weâ€™ll bathi.â€™ â€˜Bathi, Bâ€™wana Mâ€™Kumba,â€™ Molo said. P.O.M. came toward the fire wearing her blue dressing-gown and mosquito boots. â€˜Go on,â€™ she said. â€˜You can have another when you come out. Thereâ€™s nice, warm, muddy water.â€™ â€˜They bully us,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Do you remember the time we were sheep hunting and your hat blew off and nearly fell on to the ram?â€™ I asked her, the whisky racing my mind back to Wyoming. â€˜Go take your bathi,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Iâ€™m going to have a gimlet.â€™ In the morning we were dressed before daylight, ate breakfast, and were hunting the forest edge and the sunken valleys where Droop had seen the buffalo before the sun was up. But they were not there. It was a long hunt and we came back to camp and decided to send the lorries for porters and move with a foot safari to where there was supposed to be water in a stream that came down out of the mountain beyond where we had seen the rhinos the night before. Being camped there we could hunt a new country along the forest edge and we would be much closer to the mountain. The trucks were to bring in Karl from his kudu camp where he seemed to be getting disgusted, or discouraged, or both, and he could go down to the Rift Valley the next day and kill some meat and try for an oryx. If we found good rhino we would send for him. We did not want to fire any shots where we were going except at rhino in order not to scare them, and we needed meat. The rhino seemed very shy and I knew from Wyoming how the shy game will all shift out of a small country, a country being an area, a valley or range of hills, a man can hunt in, after a shot or two. We planned this all out, Pop consulting with Droopy, and then sent the lorries off with Dan to recruit porters. Late in the afternoon they were back with Karl, his outfit, and forty Mâ€™Bulus, good-looking savages with a pompous headman who wore the only pair of shorts among them. Karl was thin now, his skin sallow, his eyes very tired looking and he seemed a little desperate. He had been eight days in the kudu camp in the hills, hunting hard, with no one with him who spoke any English, and they had only seen two cows and jumped a bull out of range. The guides claimed they had seen another bull but Karl had thought it was kongoni, or that they said it was a kongoni, and had not shot. He was bitter about this and it was not a happy outfit. â€˜I never saw his horns. I donâ€™t believe it was a bull,â€™ he said. Kudu hunting was a touchy subject with him now and we let it alone. â€˜Heâ€™ll get an oryx down there and heâ€™ll feel better,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Itâ€™s gotten on his nerves a little.â€™ Karl agreed to the plan for us to move ahead into the new country, and for him to go down for meat. â€˜Whatever you say,â€™ he said. â€˜Absolutely whatever you say.â€™ â€˜It will give him some shooting,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Then heâ€™ll feel better.â€™ â€˜Weâ€™ll get one. Then you get one. Whoever gets his first can go on down after oryx. Youâ€™ll probably get an oryx to-morrow anyway when youâ€™re hunting meat.â€™ â€˜Whatever you say,â€™ Karl said. His mind was bitterly revolving eight blank days of hill climbing in the heat, out before daybreak, back at dark, hunting an animal whose Swahili name he could not then remember, with trackers in whom he had no confidence, coming back to eat alone, no one to whom he could talk, his wife nine thousand miles and three months away, and how was his dog and how was his job, and god-damn it where were they and what if he missed one when he got a shot, he wouldnâ€™t, you never missed when it was really important, he was sure of that, that was one of the tenets of his faith, but what if he got excited and missed, and why didnâ€™t he get any letters, what did the guide say kongoni for that time, they did, he knew they did, but he said nothing of all that, only, â€˜Whatever you sayâ€™, a little desperately. â€˜Come on, cheer up, you bastard,â€™ I said. â€˜Iâ€™m cheerful. Whatâ€™s the matter with you?â€™ â€˜Have a drink.â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t want a drink. I want a kudu.â€™ Later Pop said, â€˜I thought heâ€™d do well off by himself with no one to hurry him or rattle him. Heâ€™ll be all right. Heâ€™s a good lad.â€™ â€˜He wants someone to tell him exactly what to do and still leave him alone and not rattle him,â€™ I said. â€˜Itâ€™s hell for him to shoot in front of everybody. Heâ€™s not a damned show-off like me.â€™ â€˜He made a damned fine shot at that leopard,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Two of them,â€™ I said. â€˜The second was as good as the first. Hell, he can shoot. On the range heâ€™ll shoot the pants off of any of us. But he worries about it and I rattle him trying to get him to speed up.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™re a little hard on him sometimes,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Hell, he knows me. He knows what I think of him. He doesnâ€™t mind.â€™ â€˜I still think heâ€™ll find himself off by himself,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Itâ€™s just a question of confidence. Heâ€™s really a good shot.â€™ â€˜Heâ€™s got the best buff, the best waterbuck, and the best lion, now,â€™ I said. â€˜Heâ€™s got nothing to worry about.â€™ â€˜The Memsahib has the best lion, brother. Donâ€™t make any mistake about that.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m glad of that. But heâ€™s got a damned fine lion and a big leopard. Everything he has is good. Weâ€™ve got plenty of time. Heâ€™s got nothing to worry about. What the hell is he so gloomy about?â€™ â€˜Weâ€™ll get an early start in the morning so we can finish it off before it gets too hot for the little Memsahib.â€™ â€˜Sheâ€™s in the best shape of any one.â€™ â€˜Sheâ€™s marvellous. Sheâ€™s like a little terrier.â€™ We went out that afternoon and glassed the country from the hills and never saw a thing. That night after supper we were in the tent. P.O.M. disliked intensely being compared to a little terrier. If she must be like any dog, and she did not wish to be, she would prefer a wolfhound, something lean, racy, long-legged and ornamental. Her courage was so automatic and so much a simple state of being that she never thought of danger; then, too, danger was in the hands of Pop and for Pop she had a complete, clear-seeing, absolutely trusting adoration. Pop was her ideal of how a man should be, brave, gentle, comic, never losing his temper, never bragging, never complaining except in a joke, tolerant, understanding, intelligent, drinking a little too much as a good man should, and, to her eyes, very handsome. â€˜Donâ€™t you think Popâ€™s handsome?â€™ â€˜No,â€™ I said. â€˜Droopyâ€™s handsome.â€™ â€˜Droopyâ€™s beautiful. But donâ€™t you really think Popâ€™s handsome?â€™ â€˜Hell, no. I like him as well as any man Iâ€™ve ever known, but Iâ€™m damned if heâ€™s handsome.â€™ â€˜I think heâ€™s lovely looking. But you understand about how I feel about him, donâ€™t you?â€™ â€˜Sure. Iâ€™m as fond of the bastard myself.â€™ â€˜But donâ€™t you think heâ€™s handsome, really?â€™ â€˜Nope.â€™ Then, a little later: â€˜Well, whoâ€™s handsome to you?â€™ â€˜Belmonte and Pop. And you.â€™ â€˜Donâ€™t be patriotic,â€™ I said. â€˜Whoâ€™s a beautiful woman?â€™ â€˜Garbo.â€™ â€˜Not any more. Josie is. Margot is.â€™ â€˜Yes, they are. I know Iâ€™m not.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™re lovely.â€™ â€˜Letâ€™s talk about Mr. J. P. I donâ€™t like you to call him Pop. Itâ€™s not dignified.â€™ â€˜He and I arenâ€™t dignified together.â€™ â€˜Yes, but Iâ€™m dignified with him. Donâ€™t you think heâ€™s wonderful?â€™ â€˜Yes, and he doesnâ€™t have to read books written by some female heâ€™s tried to help get published saying how heâ€™s yellow.â€™ â€˜Sheâ€™s just jealous and malicious. You never should have helped her. Some people never forgive that.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s a shame, though, with all that talent gone to malice and nonsense and self-praise. Itâ€™s a goddamned shame, really. Itâ€™s a shame you never knew her before she went to pot. You know a funny thing; she never could write dialogue. It was terrible. She learned how to do it from my stuff and used it in that book. She had never written like that before. She never could forgive learning that and she was afraid people would notice it, where sheâ€™d learned it, so she had to attack me. Itâ€™s a funny racket, really. But I swear she was nice before she got ambitious. You would have liked her then, really.â€™ â€˜Maybe, but I donâ€™t think so,â€™ said P.O.M. â€˜We have fun though, donâ€™t we? Without all those people.â€™ â€˜God damn it if we donâ€™t. Iâ€™ve had a better time every year since I can remember.â€™ â€˜But isnâ€™t Mr. J. P. wonderful? Really?â€™ â€˜Yes. Heâ€™s wonderful.â€™ â€˜Oh, youâ€™re nice to say it. Poor Karl.â€™ â€˜Why?â€™ â€˜Without his wife.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ I said. â€˜Poor Karl.â€™ CHAPTER TWO So in the morning, again, we started ahead of the porters and went down and across the hills and through a deeply forested valley and then up and across a long rise of country with high grass that made the walking difficult, and on and up and across, resting sometimes in the shade of a tree, and then on and up and down and across, all in high grass now, that you had to break a trail in, and the sun was very hot. The five of us in single file, Droop and Mâ€™Cola with a big gun apiece, hung with musettes and water bottles and the cameras, we all sweating in the sun, Pop and I with guns and the Memsahib trying to walk like Droopy, her Stetson tilted on one side, happy to be on a water), and when they put up the bust of Flaubert in the Luxembourg on the short cut through the gardens on the way to the rue Soufflot (one that we believed in, loved without criticism, heavy now in stone as an idol should be). He had not seen war but he had seen a revolution and the Commune, and a revolution is much the best if you do not become bigoted because every one speaks the same language. Just as civil war is the best war for a writer, the most complete. Stendhal had seen a war and Napoleon taught him to write. He was teaching everybody then; but no one else learned. Dostoevski was made by being sent to Siberia. Writers are forged in injustice as a sword is forged. I wondered if it would make a writer of him, give him the necessary shock to cut the over-flow of words and give him a sense of proportion, if they sent Tom Wolfe to Siberia or to the Dry Tortugas. Maybe it would and maybe it wouldnâ€™t. He seemed sad, really, like Carnera. Tolstoy was a small man. Joyce was of medium height and he wore his eyes out. And that last night, drunk, with Joyce and the thing he kept quoting from Edgar Quinet, â€˜FraÃ®che et rose comme au jour de la batailleâ€™. I didnâ€™t have it right I knew. And when you saw him he would take up a conversation interrupted three years before. It was nice to see a great writer in our time. What I had to do was work. I did not care, particularly, how it all came out. I did not take my own life seriously any more, any one elseâ€™s life, yes, but not mine. They all wanted something that I did not want and I would get it without wanting it, if I worked. To work was the only thing, it was the one thing that always made you feel good, and in the meantime it was my own damned life and I would lead it where and how I pleased. And where I had led it now pleased me very much. This was a better sky than Italy. The hell it was. The best sky was in Italy and Spain and Northern Michigan in the fall and in the fall in the Gulf off Cuba. You could beat this sky; but not the country. All I wanted to do now was get back to Africa. We had not left it, yet, but when I would wake in the night I would lie, listening, homesick for it already. Now, looking out the tunnel of trees over the ravine at the sky with white clouds moving across in the wind, I loved the country so that I was happy as you are after you have been with a woman that you really love, when, empty, you feel it welling up again and there it is and you can never have it all and yet what there is, now, you can have, and you want more and more, to have, and be, and live in, to possess now again for always, for that long, sudden-ended always; making time stand still, sometimes so very still that afterwards you wait to hear it move, and it is slow in starting. But you are not alone, because if you have ever really loved her happy and untragic, she loves you always; no matter whom she loves nor where she goes she loves you more. So if you have loved some woman and some country you are very fortunate and, if you die afterwards, it makes no difference. Now, being in Africa, I was hungry for more of it, the changes of the seasons, the rains with no need to travel, the discomforts that you paid to make it real, the names of the trees, of the small animals, and all the birds, to know the language and have time to be in it and to move slowly. I have loved country all my life; the country was always better than the people. I could only care about people a very few at a time. P.O.M. was sleeping. She was always lovely to look at asleep, sleeping quietly, close curled like an animal, with nothing of the being dead look that Karl had asleep. Pop slept quietly too, you could see his soul was close in his body. His body no longer housed him fittingly. It had gone on and changed, thickening here, losing its lines, bloating a little there, but inside he was young and lean and tall and hard as when he galloped lion on the plain below Wami, and the pouches under his eyes were all outside, so that now I saw him asleep the way P.O.M. saw him always. Mâ€™Cola was an old man asleep, without history and without mystery. Droopy did not sleep. He sat on his heels and watched for the safari. We saw them coming a long way off. At first the boxes just showed above the high grass, then a line of heads, then they were in a hollow, and there was only the point of a spear in the sun, then they came up a rise of ground and I could see the strung out line coming towards us. They had gone a little too far to the left and Droopy waved to signal them toward us. They made camp, Pop warning them to be quiet, and we sat under the dining tent and were comfortable in the chairs and talked. That night we hunted and saw nothing. The next morning we hunted and saw nothing and the next evening the same. It was very interesting but there were no results. The wind blew hard from the east and the ground was broken in short ridges of hills coming down close from the forest so you could not get above it without sending your scent on ahead of you on the wind to warn everything. You could not see into the sun in the evening, nor on the heavy shadowed hillsides to the west, beyond which the sun was setting at the time the rhino would be coming out of the forest; so all the country to the westward was a loss in the evening and in the country we could hunt we found nothing. Meat came in from Karlâ€™s camp by some porters we sent back. They came in carrying quarters of tommy, grant, and wildebeeste, dusty, the meat seared dry by the sun, and the porters were happy, crouched around their fires roasting the meat on sticks. Pop was puzzled why the rhino were all gone. Each day we had seen less and we discussed whether it could be the full moon, that they fed out at night and were back in the forest in the morning before it was light, or that they winded us, or heard the men, and were simply shy and kept in the forest, or what was it? Me putting out the theories, Pop pricking them with his wit, sometimes considering them from politeness, sometimes with interest, like the one about the moon. We went to bed early and in the night it rained a little, not a real rain but a shower from the mountains, and in the morning we were up before daylight and had climbed up to the top of the steep grassy ridge that looked down on to the camp, on to the ravine of the river bed, and across to the steep opposite bank of the stream, and from where we could see all the hilly slopes and the edge of the forest. It was not yet light when some geese flew overhead and the light was still too grey to be able to see the edge of the forest clearly in the glasses. We had scouts out on three different hill tops and we were waiting for it to be light enough for us to see them if they signalled. Then Pop said, â€˜Look at that son of a bitchâ€™, and shouted at Mâ€™Cola to bring the rifles. Mâ€™Cola went jumping down the hill, and across the stream, directly opposite us, a rhino was running with a quick trot along the top of the bank. As we watched he speeded up and came, fast trotting, angling down across the face of the bank. He was a muddy red, his horn showed clearly, and there was nothing ponderous in his quick, purposeful movement. I was very excited at seeing him. â€˜Heâ€™ll cross the stream,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Heâ€™s shootable.â€™ Mâ€™Cola put the Springfield in my hand and I opened it to make sure I had solids. The Rhino was out of sight now but I could see the shaking of the high grass. â€˜How far would you call it?â€™ â€˜All of three hundred.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ll bust the son of a bitch.â€™ I was watching, freezing myself deliberately inside, stopping the excitement as you close a valve, going into that impersonal state you shoot from. He showed, trotting into the shallow, boulder-filled stream. Thinking of one thing, that the shot was perfectly possible, but that I must lead him enough, must get ahead, I got on him, then well ahead of him, and squeezed off. I heard the whonk of the bullet and, from his trot, he seemed to explode forward. With a whooshing snort he smashed ahead, splashing water and snorting. I shot again and raised a little column of water behind him, and shot again as he went into the grass; behind him again. â€˜Piga,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said. â€˜Piga!â€™ Droopy agreed. â€˜Did you hit him?â€™ Pop said. â€˜Absolutely,â€™ I said. â€˜I think Iâ€™ve got him.â€™ Droopy was running and I re-loaded and ran off after him. Half the camp was strung out across the hills waving and yelling. The rhino had come in right below where they were and gone on up the valley towards where the forest came close down into the head of the valley. Pop and P.O.M. came up. Pop with his big gun and Mâ€™Cola carrying mine. â€˜Droopy will get the tracks,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Mâ€™Cola swears you hit him.â€™ â€˜Piga!â€™ Mâ€™Cola said. â€˜He snorted like a steam engine,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Didnâ€™t he look wonderful going along there?â€™ â€˜He was late getting home with the milk,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Are you sure you hit him? It was a godawful long shot.â€™ â€˜I know I hit him. Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ve killed him.â€™ â€˜Donâ€™t tell any one if you did,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Theyâ€™ll never believe you. Look! Droopyâ€™s got blood.â€™ Below, in the high grass, Droop was holding up a grass blade towards us. Then, stooped, he went on trailing fast by the blood spoor. â€˜Piga,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said. â€˜Mâ€™uzuri!â€™ â€˜Weâ€™ll keep up above where we can see if he makes a break,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Look at Droopy.â€™ Droop had removed his fez and held it in his hand. â€˜Thatâ€™s all the precautions he needs,â€™ Pop said. â€˜We bring up a couple of heavy guns and Droopy goes in after him with one article less of clothing.â€™ Below us Droopy and his partner who was trailing with him had stopped. Droopy held up his hand. â€˜They hear him,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Come on.â€™ We started toward them. Droopy came toward us and spoke to Pop. â€˜Heâ€™s in there,â€™ Pop whispered. â€˜They can hear the tick birds. One of the boys says he heard the faro, too. Weâ€™ll go in against the wind. You go ahead with Droopy. Let the Memsahib stay behind me. Take the big gun. All right.â€™ The rhino was in high grass, somewhere in there behind some bushes. As we went forward we heard a deep, moaning sort of groan. Droopy looked around at me and grinned. The noise came again, ending this time like a blood-choked sigh. Droopy was laughing. â€˜Faro,â€™ he whispered and put his hand palm open on the side of his head in the gesture that means to go to sleep. Then in a jerky-flighted, sharp-beaked little flock we saw the tick birds rise and fly away. We knew where he was and, as we went slowly forward, parting the high grass, we saw him. He was on his side, dead. â€˜Better shoot him once to make sure,â€™ Pop said. Mâ€™Cola handed me the Springfield he had been carrying. I noticed it was cocked, looked at Mâ€™Cola, furious with him, kneeled down and shot the rhino in the sticking place. He never moved. Droopy shook my hand and so did Mâ€™Cola. â€˜He had that damned Springfield cocked,â€™ I said to Pop. The cocked gun, behind my back, made me black angry. That meant nothing to Mâ€™Cola. He was very happy, stroking the rhinoâ€™s horn, measuring it with his fingers spread, looking for the bullet hole. â€˜Itâ€™s on the side heâ€™s lying on,â€™ I said. â€˜You should have seen him when he was protecting Mama,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Thatâ€™s why he had the gun cocked.â€™ â€˜Can he shoot?â€™ â€˜No,â€™ Pop said. â€˜But he would.â€™ â€˜Shoot me in the pants,â€™ I said. â€˜Romantic bastard.â€™ When the whole outfit came up, we rolled the rhino into a sort of kneeling position and cut away the grass to take some pictures. The bullet hole was fairly high in the back, a little behind the lungs. â€˜That was a hell of a shot,â€™ Pop said. â€˜A hell of a shot. Donâ€™t ever tell any one you made that one.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™ll have to give me a certificate.â€™ â€˜That would just make us both liars. Theyâ€™re a strange beast, arenâ€™t they?â€™ There he was, long-hulked, heavy-sided, prehistoric looking, the hide like vulcanized rubber and faintly transparent looking, scarred with a badly healed horn wound that the birds had pecked at, his tail thick, round, and pointed, flat many-legged ticks crawling on him, his ears fringed with hair, tiny pig eyes, moss growing on the base of his horn that grew out forward from his nose. Mâ€™Cola looked at him and shook his head. I agreed with him. This was the hell of an animal. â€˜How is his horn?â€™ â€˜It isnâ€™t bad,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Itâ€™s nothing extra. That was a hell of a shot you made on him though, brother.â€™ â€˜Mâ€™Colaâ€™s pleased with it,â€™ I said. â€˜Youâ€™re pretty pleased with it yourself,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Iâ€™m crazy about it,â€™ I said. â€˜But donâ€™t let me start on it. Donâ€™t worry about how I feel about it. I can wake up and think about that any night.â€™ â€˜And youâ€™re a good tracker, and a hell of a fine bird shot, too,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Tell us the rest of that.â€™ â€˜Lay off me. I only said that once when I was drunk.â€™ â€˜Once,â€™ said P.O.M. â€˜Doesnâ€™t he tell us that every night?â€™ â€˜By God, I am a good bird shot.â€™ â€˜Amazing,â€™ said Pop. â€˜I never would have thought it. What else is it you do?â€™ â€˜Oh, go to hell.â€™ â€˜Mustnâ€™t ever let him realize what a shot that was or heâ€™ll get unbearable,â€™ Pop said to P.O.M. â€˜Mâ€™Cola and I know,â€™ I said. Mâ€™Cola came up. â€˜Mâ€™uzuri, Bâ€™wana,â€™ he said. â€˜Mâ€™uzuri sana.â€™ â€˜He thinks you did it on purpose,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Donâ€™t you ever tell him different.â€™ â€˜Piga mâ€™uzuri,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said. â€˜Mâ€™uzuri.â€™ â€˜I believe he feels just the way you do about it,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Heâ€™s my pal.â€™ â€˜I believe he is, you know,â€™ Pop said. On our way back across country to our main camp I made a fancy shot on a reedbuck at about two hundred yards, offhand, breaking his neck at the base of the skull. Mâ€™Cola was very pleased and Droopy was delighted. â€˜Weâ€™ve got to put a stop to him,â€™ Pop said to P.O.M. â€˜Where did you shoot for, really?â€™ â€˜In the neck,â€™ I lied. I had held full on the centre of the shoulder. â€˜It was awfully pretty,â€™ P.O.M. said. The bullet had made a crack when it hit like a bat swung against a fast ball and the buck had collapsed without a move. â€˜I think heâ€™s a damned liar,â€™ Pop said. â€˜None of us great shots is appreciated. Wait till weâ€™re gone.â€™ â€˜His idea of being appreciated is for us to carry him on our shoulders,â€™ Pop said. â€˜That rhino shot has ruined him.â€™ â€˜All right. You watch from now on. Hell, Iâ€™ve shot well the whole time.â€™ â€˜I seem to remember a grant of some sort,â€™ Pop was teasing. So did I remember him. Iâ€™d followed a fine one out of the country missing shot after shot all morning after a series of stalks in the heat, then crawled up to an ant hill to shoot one that was not nearly as good, taken a rest on the ant hill, missed the buck at fifty yards, seen him stand facing me, absolutely still, his nose up, and shot him in the chest. He went over backwards and as I went up to him he jumped up and went off, staggering. I sat down and waited for him to stop and when he did, obviously anchored, I sat there, using the sling, and shot for his neck, slowly and carefully, missing him eight times straight in a mounting, stubborn rage, not making a correction but shooting exactly for the same place in the same way each time, the gun bearers all laughing, the truck that had come up with the outfit holding more amused niggers, P.O.M. and Pop saying nothing, me sitting there cold, crazy-stubborn-furious, determined to break his neck rather than walk up and perhaps start him off over that heat-hazy, baking, noontime plain. Nobody said anything. I reached up my hand to Mâ€™Cola for more cartridges, shot again, carefully, and missed, and on the tenth shot broke his damned neck. I turned away without looking toward him. â€˜Poor Papa,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Itâ€™s the light and the wind,â€™ Pop said. We had not known each other very well then. â€˜They were all hitting the same place. I could see them throw the dust.â€™ â€˜I was a bloody, stubborn fool,â€™ I said. Anyway, I could shoot now. So far, and aided by flukes, my luck was running now. We came on into sight of camp and shouted. No one came out. Finally Karl came out of his tent. He went back as soon as he saw us, then came out again. â€˜Hey, Karl,â€™ I yelled. He waved and went back in the tent again. Then came toward us. He was shaky with excitement and I saw he had been washing blood off his hands. â€˜What is it?â€™ â€˜Rhino,â€™ he said. â€˜Did you get in trouble with him?â€™ â€˜No. We killed him.â€™ â€˜Fine. Where is he?â€™ â€˜Over there behind that tree.â€™ We went over. There was the newly severed head of a rhino that was a rhino. He was twice the size of the one I had killed. The little eyes were shut and a fresh drop of blood stood in the corner of one like a tear. The head bulked enormous and the horn swept up and back in a fine curve. The hide was an inch thick where it hung in a cape behind the head and was as white where it was cut as freshly sliced coco-nut. â€˜What is he? About thirty inches?â€™ â€˜Hell, no,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Not thirty inches.â€™ â€˜But he iss a very fine one, Mr. Jackson,â€™ Dan said. â€˜Yes. Heâ€™s a fine one,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Where did you get him?â€™ â€˜Just outside of camp.â€™ â€˜He wass standing in some bush. We heard him grunt.â€™ â€˜We thought he was a buffalo,â€™ Karl said. â€˜He iss a very fine one,â€™ Dan repeated. â€˜Iâ€™m damned glad you got him,â€™ I said. There we were, the three of us, wanting to congratulate, waiting to be good sports about this rhino whose smaller horn was longer than our big one, this huge, tear-eyed marvel of a rhino, this dead, head-severed dream rhino, and instead we all spoke like people who were about to become seasick on a boat, or people who had suffered some heavy financial loss. We were ashamed and could do nothing about it. I wanted to say something pleasant and hearty, instead, â€˜How many times did you shoot him?â€™ I asked. â€˜I donâ€™t know. We didnâ€™t count. Five or six, I guess.â€™ â€˜Five, I think,â€™ said Dan. Poor Karl, faced by these three sad-faced congratulators, was beginning to feel his pleasure in the rhino drained away from him. â€˜We got one too,â€™ said P.O.M. â€˜Thatâ€™s fine,â€™ said Karl. â€˜Is he bigger than this one?â€™ â€˜Hell, no. Heâ€™s a lousy runt.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m sorry,â€™ Karl said. He meant it, simply and truly. â€˜What the hell have you got to be sorry about with a rhino like that? Heâ€™s a beauty. Let me get the camera and take some pictures of him.â€™ I went after the camera. P.O.M. took me by the arm and walked close beside me. â€˜Papa, please try to act like a human being,â€™ she said. â€˜Poor Karl. Youâ€™re making him feel dreadfully.â€™ â€˜I know it,â€™ I said. â€˜Iâ€™m trying not to act that way.â€™ There was Pop. He shook his head. â€˜I never felt more of a four-letter man,â€™ he said. â€˜But it was like a kick in the stomach. Iâ€™m really delighted, of course.â€™ â€˜Me too,â€™ I said. â€˜Iâ€™d rather have him beat me. You know that. Truly. But why couldnâ€™t he just get a good one, two or three inches longer? Why did he have to get one that makes mine ridiculous? It just makes ours silly.â€™ â€˜You can always remember that shot.â€™ â€˜To hell with that shot. That bloody fluke. God, what a beautiful rhino.â€™ â€˜Come on, letâ€™s pull ourselves together and try to act like white people with him.â€™ â€˜We were awful,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜I know it,â€™ I said. â€˜And all the time I was trying to be jolly. You know Iâ€™m delighted he has it.â€™ â€˜You were certainly jolly. Both of you,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜But did you see Mâ€™Cola,â€™ Pop asked. Mâ€™Cola had looked at the rhino dismally, shaken his head and walked away. â€˜Heâ€™s a wonderful rhino,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜We must act decently and make Karl feel good.â€™ But it was too late. We could not make Karl feel good and for a long time we could not feel good ourselves. The porters came into camp with the loads and we could see them all, and all of our outfit, go over to where the rhino head lay in the shade. They were all very quiet. Only the skinner was delighted to see such a rhino head in camp. â€˜Mâ€™uzuri sana,â€™ he said to me. And measured the horn with shiftings of his widespread hand. â€˜Kubwa sana!â€™ â€˜Nâ€™Dio. Mâ€™uzuri sana,â€™ I agreed. â€˜Bâ€™wana Kabor shoot him?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜Mâ€™uzuri sana.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ I agreed. â€˜Mâ€™uzuri sana.â€™ The skinner was the only gent in the outfit. We had tried, in all the shoot, never to be competitive. Karl and I had each tried to give the other the better chance on everything that came up. I was, truly, very fond of him and he was entirely unselfish and altogether self-sacrificing. I knew I could outshoot him and I could always outwalk him and, steadily, he got trophies that made mine dwarfs in comparison. He had done some of the worst shooting at game I had ever seen and I had shot badly twice on the trip, at that grant and at a bustard once on the plain, still he beat me on all the tangible things we had to show. For a while we had joked about it and I knew everything would even up. But it didnâ€™t even up. Now, on this rhino hunt, I had taken the first crack at the country. We had sent him after meat while we had gone into a new country. We had not treated him badly, but we had not treated him too well, and still he had beaten me. Not only beaten, beaten was all right. He had made my rhino look so small that I could never keep him in the same small town where we lived. He had wiped him out. I had the shot I had made on him to remember and nothing could take that away except that it was so bloody marvellous I knew I would wonder, sooner or later, if it was not really a fluke in spite of my unholy self-confidence. Old Karl had put it on us all right with that rhino. He was in his tent now, writing a letter. Under the dining tent fly Pop and I talked over what we had better do. â€˜Heâ€™s got his rhino anyway,â€™ Pop said. â€˜That saves us time. Now you canâ€™t stand on that one.â€™ â€˜No.â€™ â€˜But this country is washed out. Something wrong with it. Droopy claims to know a good country about three hours from here in the lorries and another hour or so on with the porters. We can head for there this afternoon with a light outfit, send the lorries back, and Karl and Dan can move on down to Mâ€™uto Umbu and he can get his oryx.â€™ â€˜Fine.â€™ â€˜He has a chance to get a leopard on that rhino carcass this evening, too, or in the morning. Dan said they heard one. Weâ€™ll try to get a rhino out of this country of Droopyâ€™s and then you join up with them and go on for kudu. We want to leave plenty of time for them.â€™ â€˜Fine.â€™ â€˜Even if you donâ€™t get an oryx. Youâ€™ll pick one up somewhere.â€™ â€˜Even if I donâ€™t get one at all, itâ€™s all right. Weâ€™ll get one another time. I want a kudu, though.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™ll get one. Youâ€™re sure to.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™d rather get one, a good one, than all the rest. I donâ€™t give a damn about these rhino outside of the fun of hunting them. But Iâ€™d like to get one that wouldnâ€™t look silly beside that dream rhino of his.â€™ â€˜Absolutely.â€™ So we told Karl and he said: â€˜Whatever you say. Sure. I hope you get one twice as big.â€™ He really meant it. He was feeling better now and so were we all. CHAPTER THREE Droopyâ€™s country, when we reached it that evening, after a hot ride through red-soiled, bush-scrubby hills, looked awful. It was at the edge of a belt where all the trees had been girdled to kill the tsetse flies. And across from camp was a dusty, dirty native village. The soil was red and eroded and seemed to be blowing away, and camp was pitched in a high wind under the sketchy shade of some dead trees on a hillside overlooking a little stream and the mud village beyond. Before dark we followed Droopy and two local guides up past the village and in a long climb to the top of a rock-strewn ridge that overlooked a deep valley that was almost a canyon. Across on the other side, were broken valleys that sloped steeply down into the canyon. There were heavy growths of trees in the valleys and grassy slopes on the ridges between, and above there was the thick bamboo forest of the mountain. The canyon ran down to the Rift Valley, seeming to narrow at the far end where it cut through the wall of the rift. Beyond, above the grassy ridges and slopes, were heavily forested hills. It looked a hell of a country to hunt. â€˜If you see one across there you have to go straight down to the bottom of the canyon. Then up one of those timber patches and across those damned gullies. You canâ€™t keep him in sight and youâ€™ll kill yourself climbing. Itâ€™s too steep. Those are the kind of innocent-looking gullies we got into that night coming home.â€™ â€˜It looks very bad,â€™ Pop agreed. â€˜Iâ€™ve hunted a country just like this for deer. The south slope of Timber Creek in Wyoming. The slopes are all too steep. Itâ€™s hell. Itâ€™s too broken. Weâ€™ll take some punishment to-morrow.â€™ P.O.M. said nothing. Pop had brought us here and Pop would bring us out. All she had to do was see her boots did not hurt her feet. They hurt just a little now, and that was her only worry. I went on to dilate on the difficulties the country showed and we went home to camp in the dark all very gloomy and full of prejudice against Droopy. The fire flamed brightly in the wind and we sat and watched the moon rise and listened to the hyenas. After we had a few drinks we did not feel so badly about the country. â€˜Droopy swears itâ€™s good,â€™ Pop said. â€˜This isnâ€™t where he wanted to go though, he says. It was another place farther on. But he swears this is good.â€™ â€˜I love Droopy,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜I have perfect confidence in Droopy.â€™ Droopy came up to the fire with two spear-carrying natives. â€˜What does he hear?â€™ I asked. There was some talk by the natives, then Pop said: â€˜One of these sportsmen claims he was chased by a huge rhino to-day. Of course nearly any rhino would look huge when he was chasing him.â€™ â€˜Ask him how long the horn was.â€™ The native showed that the horn was as long as his arm. Droopy grinned. â€˜Tell him to go,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Where did all this happen?â€™ â€˜Oh, over there somewhere,â€™ Pop said. â€˜You know. Over there. Way over there. Where these things always happen.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s marvellous. Just where we want to go.â€™ â€˜The good aspect is that Droopyâ€™s not at all depressed,â€™ Pop said. â€˜He seems very confident. After all, itâ€™s his show.â€™ â€˜Yes, but we have to do the climbing.â€™ â€˜Cheer him up, will you?â€™ Pop said to P.O.M. â€˜Heâ€™s getting me very depressed.â€™ â€˜Should we talk about how well he shoots?â€™ â€˜Too early in the evening. Iâ€™m not gloomy. Iâ€™ve just seen that kind of country before. It will be good for us all right. Take some of your belly off, Governor.â€™ The next day I found that I was all wrong about that country. We had breakfast before daylight and were started before sunrise, climbing the hill beyond the village in single file. Ahead there was the local guide with a spear, then Droopy with my heavy gun and a water bottle, then me with the Springfield, Pop with the Mannlicher, P.O.M. pleased, as always to carry nothing, Mâ€™Cola with Popâ€™s heavy gun and another water bottle, and finally two local citizens with spears, water bags, and a chop box with lunch. We planned to lay up in the heat of the middle of the day and not get back until dark. It was fine climbing in the cool fresh morning and very different from toiling up this same trail last evening in the sunset with all the rocks and dirt giving back the heat of the day. The trail was used regularly by cattle and the dust was powdered dry and, now, lightly moistened from the dew. There were many hyena tracks and, as the trail came on to a ridge of grey rock so that you could look down on both sides into a steep ravine, and then went on along the edge of the canyon, we saw a fresh rhino track in one of the dusty patches below the rocks. â€˜Heâ€™s just gone on ahead,â€™ Pop said. â€˜They must wander all over here at night.â€™ Below, at the bottom of the canyon, we could see the tops of high trees and in an opening see the flash of water. Across were the steep hillside and the gullies we had studied last night. Droopy and the local guide, the one who had been chased by the rhino, were whispering together. Then they started down a steep path that went in long slants down the side of the canyon. We stopped. I had not seen P.O.M. was limping, and in sudden whispered family bitterness there was a highly-righteous-on-both-sides clash, historically on unwearable shoes and boots in the past, and imperatively on these, which hurt. The hurt was lessened by cutting off the toes of the heavy short wool socks worn over ordinary socks, and then, by removing the socks entirely, the boots made possible. Going down-hill steeply made these Spanish shooting boots too short in the toe and there was an old argument, about this length of boot and whether the bootmaker, whose part I had taken, unwittingly first, only as interpreter, and finally embraced his theory patriotically as a whole and, I believed, by logic, had overcome it by adding on to the heel. But they hurt now, a stronger logic, and the situation was unhelped by the statement that menâ€™s new boots always hurt for weeks before they became comfortable. Now, heavy socks removed, stepping tentatively, trying the pressure of the leather against the toes, the argument past, she wanting not to suffer, but to keep up and please Mr. J. P., me ashamed at having been a four-letter man about boots, at being righteous against pain, at being righteous at all, at ever being righteous, stopping to whisper about it, both of us grinning at what was whispered, it all right now, the boots too, without the heavy socks, much better, me hating all righteous bastards now, one absent American friend especially, having just removed myself from that category, certainly never to be righteous again, watching Droopy ahead, we went down the long slant of the trail toward the bottom of the canyon where the trees were heavy and tall and the floor of the canyon, that from above had been a narrow gash, opened to a forest-banked stream. We stood now in the shade of trees with great smooth trunks, circled at their base with the line of roots that showed in rounded ridges up the trunks like arteries; the trunks the yellow green of a French forest on a day in winter after rain. But these trees had a great spread of branches and were in leaf and below them, in the stream bed in the sun, reeds like papyrus grass grew thick as wheat and twelve feet tall. There was a game trail through the grass along the stream and Droopy was bent down looking at it. Mâ€™Cola went over and looked and they both followed it a little way, stooped close over it, then came back to us. â€˜Nyati,â€™ Mâ€™Cola whispered. â€˜Buffalo.â€™ Droopy whispered to Pop and then Pop said, softly in his throaty, whisky whisper, â€˜Theyâ€™re buff gone down the river. Droop says there are some big bulls. They havenâ€™t come back.â€™ â€˜Letâ€™s follow them,â€™ I said. â€˜Iâ€™d rather get another buff than rhino.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s as good a chance as any for rhino, too,â€™ Pop said. â€˜By God, isnâ€™t it a great looking country?â€™ I said. â€˜Splendid,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Who would have imagined it?â€™ â€˜The trees are like AndrÃ©â€™s pictures,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Itâ€™s simply beautiful. Look at that green. Itâ€™s Masson. Why canâ€™t a good painter see this country?â€™ â€˜How are your boots?â€™ â€˜Fine.â€™ As we trailed the buffalo we went very slowly and quietly. There was no wind and we knew that when the breeze came up it would be from the east and blow up the canyon toward us. We followed the game trail down the river-bed and as we went the grass was much higher. Twice we had to get down to crawl and the reeds were so thick you could not see two feet into them. Droop found a fresh rhino track, too, in the mud. I began to think about what would happen if a rhino came barging along this tunnel and who would do what. It was exciting but I did not like it. It was too much like being in a trap and there was P.O.M. to think about. Then as the stream made a bend and we came out of the high grass to the bank I smelled game very distinctly. I do not smoke, and hunting at home I have several times smelled elk in the rutting season before I have seen them, and I can smell clearly where an old bull has lain in the forest. The bull elk has a strong musky smell. It is a strong but pleasant odour and I know it well, but this smell I did not know. â€˜I can smell them,â€™ I whispered to Pop. He believed me. â€˜What is it?â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t know but itâ€™s plenty strong. Canâ€™t you?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ â€˜Ask Droop.â€™ Droopy nodded and grinned. â€˜They take snuff,â€™ Pop said. â€˜I donâ€™t know whether they can scent or not.â€™ We went on into another bed of reeds that were high over our heads, putting each foot down silently before lifting the other, walking as quietly as in a dream or a slow motion picture. I could smell whatever it was clearly now, all of the time, sometimes stronger than at others. I did not like it at all. We were close to the bank now, and ahead, the game trail went straight out into a long slough of higher reeds than any we had come through. â€˜I can smell them close as hell,â€™ I whispered to Pop. â€˜No kidding. Really.â€™ â€˜I believe you,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Should we get up here on to the bank and skirt this bit? Weâ€™ll be above it.â€™ â€˜Good.â€™ Then, when we were up, I said. â€˜That tall stuff had me spooked. I wouldnâ€™t like to hunt in that.â€™ â€˜Howâ€™d you like to hunt elephant in that?â€™ Pop whispered. â€˜I wouldnâ€™t do it.â€™ â€˜Do you really hunt elephant in grass like that?â€™ P.O.M. asked. â€˜Yes,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Get up on somebodyâ€™s shoulders to shoot.â€™ Better men than I am do it, I thought. I wouldnâ€™t do it. We went along the grassy right bank, on a sort of shelf, now in the open, skirting a slough of high dry reeds. Beyond on the opposite bank were the heavy trees and above them the steep bank of the canyon. You could not see the stream. Above us, on the right, were the hills, wooded in patches of orchard bush. Ahead, at the end of the slough of reeds the banks narrowed and the branches of the big trees almost covered the stream. Suddenly Droopy grabbed me and we both crouched down. He put the big gun in my hand and took the Springfield. He pointed and around a curve in the bank I saw the head of a rhino with a long, wonderful-looking horn. The head was swaying and I could see the ears forward and twitching, and see the little pig eyes. I slipped the safety catch and motioned Droopy down. Then I heard Mâ€™Cola saying, â€˜Toto! Toto!â€™ and he grabbed my arm. Droopy was whispering, â€˜Manamouki! Manamouki! Manamouki!â€™ very fast and he and Mâ€™Cola were frantic that I should not shoot. It was a cow rhino with a calf, and as I lowered the gun she gave a snort, crashed in the reeds, and was gone. I never saw the calf. We could see the reeds swaying where the two of them were moving and then it was all quiet. â€˜Damn shame,â€™ Pop whispered. â€˜She had a beautiful horn.â€™ â€˜I was all set to bust her,â€™ I said. â€˜I couldnâ€™t tell she was a cow.â€™ â€˜Mâ€™Cola saw the calf.â€™ Mâ€™Cola was whispering to Pop and nodding his head emphatically. â€˜He says thereâ€™s another rhino in there,â€™ Pop said. â€˜That he heard him snort.â€™ â€˜Letâ€™s get higher, where we can see them if they break, and throw something in,â€™ I said. â€˜Good idea,â€™ Pop agreed. â€˜Maybe the bullâ€™s there.â€™ We went a little higher up the bank where we could look out over the lake of high reeds and, with Pop holding his big gun ready and I with the safety off mine, Mâ€™Cola threw a club into the reeds where he had heard the snort. There was a wooshing snort and no movement, not a stir in the reeds. Then there was a crashing farther away and we could see the reeds swaying with the rush of something through them toward the opposite bank, but could not see what was making the movement. Then I saw the black back, the wide-swept, point-lifted horns and then the quick-moving, climbing rush of a buffalo up the other bank. He went up, his neck up and out, his head horn-heavy, his withers rounded like a fighting bull, in fast strong-legged climb. I was holding on the point where his neck joined his shoulder when Pop stopped me. â€˜Heâ€™s not a big one,â€™ he said softly. â€˜I wouldnâ€™t take him unless you want him for meat.â€™ He looked big to me and now he stood, his head up, broadside, his head swung toward us. â€˜Iâ€™ve got three more on the licence and weâ€™re leaving their country,â€™ I said. â€˜Itâ€™s awfully good meat,â€™ Pop whispered. â€˜Go ahead then. Bust him. But be ready for the rhino after you shoot.â€™ I sat down, the big gun feeling heavy and unfamiliar, held on the buffâ€™s shoulder, squeezed off and flinched without firing. Instead of the sweet clean pull of the Springfield with the smooth, unhesitant release at the end, this trigger came to what, in a squeeze, seemed metal stuck against metal. It was like when you shoot in a nightmare. I couldnâ€™t squeeze it and I corrected from my flinch, held my breath, and pulled the trigger. It pulled off with a jerk and the big gun made a rocking explosion out of which I came, seeing the buffalo still on his feet, and going out of sight to the left in a climbing run, to let off the second barrel and throw a burst of rock dust and dirt over his hind quarters. He was out of shot before I could reload the double-barrelled Â·470 and we had all heard the snorting and the crashing of another rhino that had gone out of the lower end of the reeds and on under the heavy trees on our side without showing more than a glimpse of his bulk in the reeds. â€˜It was the bull,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Heâ€™s gone down the stream.â€™ â€˜Nâ€™Dio. Doumi! Doumi!â€™ Droopy insisted it was a bull. â€˜I hit the damned buff,â€™ I said. â€˜God knows where. To hell with those heavy guns. The trigger pull put me off.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™d have killed him with the Springfield,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Iâ€™d know where I hit him anyway. I thought with the four-seven Iâ€™d kill him or miss him,â€™ I said. â€˜Instead, now weâ€™ve got him wounded.â€™ â€˜Heâ€™ll keep,â€™ Pop said. â€˜We want to give him plenty of time.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m afraid I gut-shot him.â€™ â€˜You canâ€™t tell. Going off fast like that he might be dead in a hundred yards.â€™ â€˜The hell with that four-seventy,â€™ I said. â€˜I canâ€™t shoot it. The triggerâ€™s like the last turn of the key opening a sardine can.â€™ â€˜Come on,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Weâ€™ve got God knows how many rhino scattered about here.â€™ â€˜What about the buff?â€™ â€˜Plenty of time for him later. We must let him stiffen up. Let him get sick.â€™ â€˜Suppose weâ€™d been down there with all that stuff coming out.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ said Pop. All this in whispers. I looked at P.O.M. She was like someone enjoying a good musical show. â€˜Did you see where it hit him?â€™ â€˜I couldnâ€™t tell?â€™ she whispered. â€˜Do you suppose there are any more in there?â€™ â€˜Thousands,â€™ I said. â€˜What do we do, Pop?â€™ â€˜That bull may be just around the bend,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Come on.â€™ We went along the bank, our nerves cocked, and as we came to the narrow end of the reeds there was another rush of something heavy through the tall stalks. I had the gun up waiting for whatever it was to show. But there was only the waving of the reeds. Mâ€™Cola signalled with his hand not to shoot. â€˜The calf,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Must have been two of them. Whereâ€™s the bloody bull?â€™ â€˜How the hell do you see them?â€™ â€˜Tell by the size.â€™ Then we were standing looking down into the stream bed, into the shadows under the branches of the big trees, and off ahead down the stream when Mâ€™Cola pointed up the hill on our right. â€˜Faro,â€™ he whispered and reached me the glasses. There on the hillside, head-on, wide, black, looking straight towards us, ears twitching and head lifted, swaying as the nose searched for the wind, was another rhino. He looked huge in the glasses. Pop was studying him with his binoculars. â€˜Heâ€™s no better than what you have,â€™ he said softly. â€˜I can bust him right in the sticking place,â€™ I whispered. â€˜You have only one more,â€™ Pop whispered. â€˜You want a good one.â€™ I offered the glasses to P.O.M. â€˜I can see him without,â€™ she said. â€˜Heâ€™s huge.â€™ â€˜He may charge,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Then youâ€™ll have to take him.â€™ Then, as we watched, another rhino came into sight from behind a wide feathery-topped tree. He was quite a bit smaller. â€˜By God, itâ€™s a calf,â€™ Pop said. â€˜That oneâ€™s a cow. Good thing you didnâ€™t shoot her. She bloody well may charge too.â€™ â€˜Is it the same cow?â€™ I whispered. â€˜No. That other one had a hell of a horn.â€™ We all had the nervous exhilaration, like a laughing drunk, that a sudden over-abundance, idiotic abundance of game makes. It is a feeling that can come from any sort of game or fish that is ordinarily rare and that, suddenly, you find in a ridiculously unbelievable abundance. â€˜Look at her. She knows thereâ€™s something wrong. But she canâ€™t see us or smell us.â€™ â€˜She heard the shots.â€™ â€˜She knows weâ€™re here. But she canâ€™t make it out.â€™ The rhino looked so huge, so ridiculous, and so fine to see, and I sighted on her chest. â€˜Itâ€™s a nice shot.â€™ â€˜Perfect,â€™ Pop said. â€˜What are we going to do?â€™ P.O.M. said. She was practical. â€˜Weâ€™ll work around her,â€™ Pop said. â€˜If we keep low I donâ€™t believe our scent will carry up there once weâ€™re past.â€™ â€˜You canâ€™t tell,â€™ Pop said. â€˜We donâ€™t want her to charge.â€™ She did not charge, but dropped her head, finally, and worked up the hill followed by the nearly full-grown calf. â€˜Now,â€™ said Pop, â€˜weâ€™ll let Droop go ahead and see if he can find the bullâ€™s tracks. We might as well sit down.â€™ We sat in the shade and Droopy went up one side of the stream and the local guide the other. They came back and said the bull had gone on down. â€˜Did any one ever see what sort of horn he had?â€™ I asked. â€˜Droop said he was good.â€™ Mâ€™Cola had gone up the hill a little way. Now he crouched and beckoned. â€˜Nyati,â€™ he said with his hand up to his face. â€˜Where?â€™ Pop asked him. He pointed, crouched down, and as we crawled up to him he handed me the glasses. They were a long way away on the jutting ridge of one of the steep hillsides on the far side of the canyon, well down the stream. We could see six, then eight buffalo, black, heavy necked, the horns shining, standing on the point of a ridge. Some were grazing and others stood, their heads up, watching. â€˜That oneâ€™s a bull,â€™ Pop said, looking through the glasses. â€˜Which one?â€™ â€˜Second from the right.â€™ â€˜They all look like bulls to me.â€™ â€˜Theyâ€™re a long way away. That oneâ€™s a good bull. Now weâ€™ve got to cross the stream and work down toward them and try to get above them.â€™ â€˜Will they stay there?â€™ â€˜No. Probably theyâ€™ll work down into this stream bed as soon as itâ€™s hot.â€™ â€˜Letâ€™s go.â€™ We crossed the stream on a log and then another log and on the other side, half way up the hillside, there was a deeply worn game trail that graded along the bank under the heavily leafed branches of the trees. We went along quite fast, but walking carefully, and below us, now, the stream bed was covered solidly with foliage. It was still early in the morning but the breeze was rising and the leaves stirred over our heads. We crossed one ravine that came down to the stream, going into the thick bush to be out of sight and stooping as we crossed behind trees in the small open place, then, using the shoulder of the ravine as protection, we climbed so that we might get high up the hillside above the buffalo and work down to them. We stopped in the shelter of the ridge, me sweating heavily and fixing a handkerchief inside the sweatband of my Stetson, and sent Droop ahead to look. He came back to say they were gone. From above we could see nothing of them, so we cut across the ravine and the hillside thinking we might intercept them on their way down into the river bed. The next hillside had been burned and at the bottom of the hill there was a burned area of bush. In the ash dust were the tracks of the buffalo as they came down and into the thick jungle of the stream bed. Here it was too overgrown and there were too many vines to follow them. There were no tracks going down the stream so we knew they were down in the part of the stream bed we had looked down on from the game trail. Pop said there was nothing to do about them in there. It was so thick that if we jumped them we could not get a shot. You could not tell one from another, he said. All you could see would be a rush of black. An old bull would be grey but a good herd bull might be as black as a cow. It wasnâ€™t any good to jump them like that. It was ten oâ€™clock now and very hot in the open, the sun pegged and the breeze lifted the ashes of the burned-over ground as we walked. Everything would be in the thick cover now. We decided to find a shady place and lie down and read in the cool; to have lunch and kill the hot part of the day. Beyond the burned place we came toward the stream and stopped, sweating, in the shadow of some very large trees. We unpacked our leather coats and our raincoats and spread them on the grass at the foot of the trees so that we could lean back against the trunks. P.O.M. got out the books and Mâ€™Cola made a small fire and boiled water for tea. The breeze was coming up and we could hear it in the high branches. It was cool in the shade, but if you stirred into the sun, or as the sun shifted the shadow while you read so that any part of you was out of the shadow, the sun was heavy. Droopy had gone on down the stream to have a look, and as we lay there, reading, I could smell the heat of the day coming, the drying up of the dew, the heat on the leaves, and the heaviness of the sun over the stream. P.O.M. was reading Spanish Gold, by George A. Birmingham, and she said it was no good. I still had the Sevastopol book of Tolstoy and in the same volume I was reading a story called â€˜The Cossacksâ€™ that was very good. In it were the summer heat, the mosquitoes, the feel of the forest in the different seasons, and that river that the Tartars crossed, raiding, and I was living in that Russia again. I was thinking how real that Russia of the time of our Civil War was, as real as any other place, as Michigan, or the prairie north of town and the woods around Evanâ€™s game farm, of how, through Turgenev, I knew that I had lived there, as I had been in the family Buddenbrooks, and had climbed in and out of her window in Le Rouge et Le Noir, or the morning we had come in the gates of Paris and seen SalcÃ¨de torn apart by the horses at the Place de GrÃ¨ves. I saw all that. And it was me they did not break on the rack that time because I had been polite to the executioner the time they killed Coconas and me, and I remember the Eve of St. Bartholomewâ€™s and how we hunted Huguenots that night, and when they trapped me at her house that time, and no feeling more true than finding the gate of the Louvre being closed, nor of looking down at his body in the water where he fell from the mast, and always, Italy, better than any book, lying in the chestnut woods, and in the fall mist behind the Duomo going across the town to the Ospedale Maggiore, the nails in my boots on the cobbles, and in the spring sudden showers in the mountains and the smell of the regiment like a copper coin in your mouth. So in the heat the train stopped at Dezenzano and there was Lago de Garda and those troops are the Czech Legion, and the next time it was raining, and the next time it was in the dark, and the next time you passed it riding in a truck, and the next time you were coming from somewhere else, and the next time you walked to it in the dark from Sermione. For we have been there in the books and out of the booksâ€”and where we go, if we are any good, there you can go as we have been. A country, finally, erodes and the dust blows away, the people all die and none of them were of any importance permanently, except those who practised the arts, and these now wish to cease their work because it is too lonely, too hard to do, and is not fashionable. A thousand years makes economics silly and a work of art endures for ever, but it is very difficult to do and now it is not fashionable. People do not want to do it any more because they will be out of fashion and the lice who crawl on literature will not praise them. Also it is very hard to do. So what? So I would go on reading about the river that the Tartars came across when raiding, and the drunken old hunter and the girl and how it was then in the different seasons. Pop was reading Richard Carvell. We had bought what there was to buy in Nairobi and we were pretty well to the end of the books. â€˜Iâ€™ve read this before,â€™ Pop said. â€˜But itâ€™s a good story.â€™ â€˜I can just remember it. But it was a good story then.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s a jolly good story, but I wish I hadnâ€™t read it before.â€™ â€˜This is terrible,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜You couldnâ€™t read it.â€™ â€˜Do you want this one?â€™ â€˜Donâ€™t be ornamental,â€™ she said. â€˜No, Iâ€™ll finish this.â€™ â€˜Go on. Take it.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ll give it right back.â€™ â€˜Hey, Mâ€™Cola,â€™ I said. â€˜Beer?â€™ â€˜Nâ€™Dio,â€™ he said with great force, and from the chop box one of the natives had carried on his head produced, in its straw casing, a bottle of German beer, one of the sixty-four bottles Dan had brought from the German trading station. Its neck was wrapped in silver foil and on its black and yellow label there was a horseman in armour. It was still cool from the night and opened by the tin-opener it creamed into three cups, thick-foamed, full-bodied. â€˜No,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Very bad for the liver.â€™ â€˜Come on.â€™ â€˜All right.â€™ We all drank and when Mâ€™Cola opened the second bottle Pop refused, firmly. â€˜Go on. It means more to you. Iâ€™m going to take a nap.â€™ â€˜Poor old Mama?â€™ â€˜Just a little.â€™ â€˜All for me,â€™ I said. Mâ€™Cola smiled and shook his head at this drinking. I lay back against the tree and watched the wind bringing the clouds and drank the beer slowly out of the bottle. It was cooler that way and it was excellent beer. After a while Pop and P.O.M. were both asleep and I got back the Sevastopol book and read in â€˜The Cossacksâ€™ again. It was a good story. When they woke up we had lunch of cold sliced tenderloin, bread, and mustard, and a can of plums, and drank the third, and last, bottle of beer. Then we read again and all went to sleep. I woke thirsty and was unscrewing the top from a water bottle when I heard a rhino snort and crash in the brush of the river bed. Pop was awake and heard it too and we took our guns, without speaking, and started toward where the noise had come from. Mâ€™Cola found the tracks. The rhino had come up the stream, evidently he had winded us when he was only about thirty yards away, and had gone on up. We could not follow the tracks the way the wind was blowing so we circled away from the stream and back to the edge of the burned place to get above him and then hunted very carefully against the wind along the stream through very thick bush, but we did not find him. Finally Droopy found where he had gone up the other side and on into the hills. From the tracks it did not seem a particularly large one. We were a long way from camp, at least four hours as we had come, and much of it up-hill going back, certainly there would be that long climb out of the canyon; we had a wounded buffalo to deal with, and when we came out on the edge of the burned country again, we agreed that we should get P.O.M. and get started. It was still hot, but the sun was on its way down and for a good way we would be on the heavily shaded game trail on the high bank above the stream. When we found P.O.M. she pretended to be indignant at our going off and leaving her alone but she was only teasing us. We started off, Droop and his spearsman in the lead, walking along the shadow of the trail that was broken by the sun through the leaves. Instead of the cool early morning smell of the forest there was a nasty stink like the mess cats make. â€˜What makes the stink?â€™ I whispered to Pop. â€˜Baboons,â€™ he said. A whole tribe of them had gone on just ahead of us and their droppings were everywhere. We came up to the place where the rhinos and the buff had come out of the reeds and I located where I thought the buff had been when I shot. Mâ€™Cola and Droopy were casting about like hounds and I thought they were at least fifty yards too high up the bank when Droop held up a leaf. â€˜Heâ€™s got blood,â€™ Pop said. We went up to them. There was a great quantity of blood, black now on the grass, and the trail was easy to follow. Droop and Mâ€™Cola trailed one on each side, leaving the trail between them, pointing to each blood spot formally with a long stem of grass. I always thought it would be better for one to trail slowly and the other cast ahead but this was the way they trailed, stooped heads, pointing each dried splash with their grass stems and occasionally, when they picked up the tracks after losing them, stooping to pluck a grass blade or a leaf that had the black stain on it. I followed them with the Springfield, then came Pop, with P.O.M. behind him. Droop carried my big gun and Pop had his. Mâ€™Cola had P.O.M.â€™s Mannlicher slung over his shoulder. None of us spoke and everyone seemed to regard it as a pretty serious business. In some high grass we found blood, at a pretty good height on the grass leaves on both sides of the trail where the buff had gone through the grass. That meant he was shot clean through. You could not tell the original colour of the blood now, but I had a moment of hoping he might be shot through the lungs. But farther on we came on some droppings in the rocks with blood in them and then for a while he had dropped dung wherever he climbed and all of it was blood-spotted. It looked, now, like a gut shot or one through the paunch. I was more ashamed of it all the time. â€˜If he comes donâ€™t worry about Droopy or the others,â€™ Pop whispered. â€˜Theyâ€™ll get out of his way. Stop him.â€™ â€˜Right up the nose,â€™ I said. â€˜Donâ€™t try anything fancy,â€™ Pop said. The trail climbed steadily, then twice looped back on itself and for a time seemed to wander, without plan, among some rocks. Once it lead down to the stream, crossed a rivulet of it and then came back up on the same bank, grading up through the trees. â€˜I think weâ€™ll find him dead,â€™ I whispered to Pop. That aimless turn had made me see him, slow and hard hit, getting ready to go down. â€˜I hope so,â€™ Pop said. But the trail went on, where there was little grass now, and trailing was much slower and more difficult. There were no tracks now that I could see, only the probable line he would take, verified by a shiny dark splatter of dried blood on a stone. Several times we lost it entirely and, the three of us making casts, one would find it, point and whisper â€˜Damuâ€™, and we would go on again. Finally it led down from a rocky hillside with the last of the sun on it, down into the stream bed where there was a long, wide patch of the highest dead reeds that we had seen. These were higher and thicker even than the slough the buff had come out of in the morning and there were several game trails that went into them. â€˜Not good enough to take the little Memsahib in there,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Let her stay here with Mâ€™Cola,â€™ I said. â€˜Itâ€™s not good enough for the little Memsahib,â€™ Pop repeated. â€˜I donâ€™t know why we let her come.â€™ â€˜She can wait here. Droop wants to go on.â€™ â€˜Right you are. Weâ€™ll have a look.â€™ â€˜You wait here with Mâ€™Cola,â€™ I whispered over my shoulder. We followed Droopy into the thick, tall grass that was five feet above our heads, walking carefully on the game trail, stooping forward, trying to make no noise breathing. I was thinking of the buff the way I had seen them when we had gotten the three that time, how the old bull had come out of the bush, groggy as he was, and I could see the horns, the boss coming far down, the muzzle out, the little eyes, the roll of fat and muscle on his thin-haired, grey, scaly-hided neck, the heavy power and the rage in him, and I admired him and respected him, but he was slow, and all the while we shot I felt that it was fixed and that we had him. This was different, this was no rapid fire, no pouring it on him as he comes groggy into the open, if he comes now I must be quiet inside and put it down his nose as he comes with the head out. He will have to put the head down to hook, like any bull, and that will uncover the old place the boys wet their knuckles on and I will get one in there and then must go sideways into the grass and he would be Popâ€™s from then on unless I could keep the rifle when I jumped. I was sure I could get that one in and jump if I could wait and watch his head come down. I knew I could do that and that the shot would kill him but how long would it take? That was the whole thing. How long would it take? Now, going forward, sure he was in here, I felt the elation, the best elation of all, of certain action to come, action in which you had something to do, in which you can kill and come out of it, doing something you are ignorant about and so not scared, no one to worry about and no responsibility except to perform something you feel sure you can perform, and I was walking softly ahead watching Droopyâ€™s back and remembering to keep the sweat out of my glasses when I heard a noise behind us and turned my head. It was P.O.M. with Mâ€™Cola coming on our tracks. â€˜For Godâ€™s sake,â€™ Pop said. He was furious. We got her back out of the grass and up on to the bank and made her realize that she must stay there. She had not understood that she was to stay behind. She had heard me whisper something but thought it was for her to come behind Mâ€™Cola. â€˜That spooked me,â€™ I said to Pop. â€˜Sheâ€™s like a little terrier,â€™ he said. â€˜But itâ€™s not good enough.â€™ We were looking out over that grass. â€˜Droop wants to go still,â€™ I said. â€˜Iâ€™ll go as far as he will. When he says no that lets us out. After all, I gut-shot the son of a bitch.â€™ â€˜Mustnâ€™t do anything silly, though.â€™ â€˜I can kill the son of a bitch if I get a shot at him. If he comes heâ€™s got to give me a shot.â€™ The fright P.O.M. had given us about herself had made me noisy. â€˜Come on,â€™ said Pop. We followed Droopy back in and it got worse and worse, and I do not know about Pop but about half-way I changed to the big gun and kept the safety off and my hand over the trigger guard and I was plenty nervous by the time Droopy stopped and shook his head and whispered â€˜Hapanaâ€™. It had gotten so you could not see a foot ahead and it was all turns and twists. It was really bad and the sun was only on the hillside now. We both felt good because we had made Droopy do the calling off and I was relieved as well. What we had followed him into had made my fancy shooting plans seem very silly and I knew all we had in there was Pop to blast him over with the four-fifty number two after Iâ€™d maybe miss him with that lousy four-seventy. I had no confidence in anything but its noise any more. We were back trailing when we heard the porters on the hillside shout and we ran crashing through the grass to try to get a high enough place to see to shoot. They waved their arms and shouted that the buffalo had come out of the reeds and gone past them and then Mâ€™Cola and Droopy were pointing, and Pop had me by the sleeve trying to pull me to where I could see them and then, in the sunlight, high up on the hillside against the rocks I saw two buffalo. They shone very black in the sun and one was much bigger than the other and I remember thinking this was our bull and that he had picked up a cow and she had made the pace and kept him going. Droop had handed me the Springfield and I slipped my arm through the sling and sighting, the buff now all seen through the aperture, I froze myself inside and held the bead on the top of his shoulder and as I started to squeeze he started running and I swung ahead of him and loosed off. I saw him lower his head and jump like a bucking horse as he comes out of the chutes and as I threw the shell, slammed the bolt forward and shot again, behind him as he went out of sight, I knew I had him. Droopy and I started to run and as we were running I heard a low bellow. I stopped and yelled at Pop, â€˜Hear him? Iâ€™ve got him, I tell you!â€™ â€˜You hit him,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜Goddamn it, I killed him. Didnâ€™t you hear him bellow?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ â€˜Listen!â€™ We stood listening and there it came, clear, a long, moaning, unmistakable bellow. â€˜By God,â€™ Pop said. It was a very sad noise. Mâ€™Cola grabbed my hand and Droopy slapped my back and all laughing we started on a running scramble, sweating, rushing, up the ridge through the trees and over rocks. I had to stop for breath, my heart pounding, and wiped the sweat off my face and cleaned my glasses. â€˜Kufa!â€™ Mâ€™Cola said, making the word for dead almost explosive in its force. â€˜Nâ€™Dio! Kufa!â€™ â€˜Kufa!â€™ Droopy said grinning. â€˜Kufa!â€™ Mâ€™Cola repeated and we shook hands again before we went on climbing. Then, ahead of us, we saw him, on his back, throat stretched out to the full, his weight on his horns, wedged against a tree. Mâ€™Cola put his finger in the bullet hole in the centre of the shoulder and shook his head happily. Pop and P.O.M. came up, followed by the porters. â€˜By God, heâ€™s a better bull than we thought,â€™ I said. â€˜Heâ€™s not the same bull. This is a real bull. That must have been our bull with him.â€™ â€˜I thought he was with a cow. It was so far away I couldnâ€™t tell.â€™ â€˜It must have been four hundred yards. By God, you can shoot that little pipsqueak.â€™ â€˜When I saw him put his head down between his legs and buck I knew we had him. The light was wonderful on him.â€™ â€˜I knew you had hit him, and I knew he wasnâ€™t the same bull. So I thought we had two wounded buffalo to deal with. I didnâ€™t hear the first bellow.â€™ â€˜It was wonderful when we heard him bellow,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Itâ€™s such a sad sound. Itâ€™s like hearing a horn in the woods.â€™ â€˜It sounded awfully jolly to me,â€™ Pop said. â€˜By God, we deserve a drink on this. That was a shot. Why didnâ€™t you ever tell us you could shoot?â€™ â€˜Go to hell.â€™ â€˜You know heâ€™s a damned good tracker, too, and what kind of a bird shot?â€™ he asked P.O.M. â€˜Isnâ€™t he a beautiful bull?â€™ P.O.M. asked. â€˜Heâ€™s a fine one. Heâ€™s not old but itâ€™s a fine head.â€™ We tried to take pictures but there was only the little box camera and the shutter stuck, and there was a bitter argument about the shutter while the light failed, and I was nervous now, irritable, righteous, pompous about the shutter and inclined to be abusive because we could get no picture. You cannot live on a plane of the sort of elation I had felt in the reeds and having killed, even when it is only a buffalo, you feel a little quiet inside. Killing is not a feeling that you share and I took a drink of water and told P.O.M. I was sorry I was such a bastard about the camera. She said it was all right and we were all right again looking at the buff with Mâ€™Cola making the cuts for the headskin and we standing close together and feeling fond of each other and understanding everything, camera and all. I took a drink of the whisky and it had no taste and I felt no kick from it. â€˜Let me have another,â€™ I said. The second one was all right. We were going on ahead to camp with the chased-by-a-rhino spearman as guide and Droop was going to skin out the head and they were going to butcher and cache the meat in trees so the hyenas would not get it. They were afraid to travel in the dark and I told Droopy he could keep my big gun. He said he knew how to shoot so I took out the shells and put on the safety and handing it to him told him to shoot. He put it to his shoulder, shut the wrong eye, and pulled hard on the trigger, and again, and again. Then I showed him about the safety and had him put it on and off and snap the gun a couple of times. Mâ€™Cola became very superior during Droopyâ€™s struggle to fire with the safety on and Droopy seemed to get much smaller. I left him the gun and two cartridges and they were all busy butchering in the dusk when we followed the spearsman and the tracks of the smaller buff, which had no blood on them, up to the top of the hill and on our way toward home. We climbed around the tops of valleys, went across gulches, up and down ravines and finally came on to the main ridge, it dark and cold in the evening, the moon not yet up, we plodded along, all tired. Once Mâ€™Cola, in the dark, loaded with Popâ€™s heavy gun and an assortment of water bottles, binoculars, and a musette bag of books, sung out a stream of what sounded like curses at the guide who was striding ahead. â€˜Whatâ€™s he say?â€™ I asked Pop. â€˜Heâ€™s telling him not to show off his speed. That there is an old man in the party.â€™ â€˜Who does he mean, you or himself?â€™ â€˜Both of us.â€™ We saw the moon come up, smoky red over the brown hills, and we came down through the chinky lights of the village, the mud houses all closed tight, and the smells of goats and sheep, and then across the stream and up the bare slope to where the fire was burning in front of our tents. It was a cold night with much wind. In the morning we hunted, picked up a track at a spring and trailed a rhino all over the high orchard country before he went down into a valley that led, steeply, into the canyon. It was very hot and the tight boots of the day before had chafed P.O.M.â€™s feet. She did not complain about them but I could see they hurt her. We were all luxuriantly, restfully tired. â€˜The hell with them,â€™ I said to Pop. â€˜I donâ€™t want to kill another one unless heâ€™s big. We might hunt a week for a good one. Letâ€™s stand on the one we have and pull out and join Karl. We can hunt oryx down there and get those zebra hides and get on after the kudu.â€™ We were sitting under a tree on the summit of a hill and could see off over all the country and the canyon running down to the Rift Valley and Lake Manyara. â€˜It would be good fun to take porters and a light outfit and hunt on ahead of them down through that valley and out to the lake,â€™ Pop said. â€˜That would be swell. We could send the lorries around to meet us at whatâ€™s the name of the place?â€™ â€˜Maji-Moto.â€™ â€˜Why donâ€™t we do that?â€™ P.O.M. asked. â€˜Weâ€™ll ask Droopy how the valley is.â€™ Droopy didnâ€™t know but the spearman said it was very rough and bad going where the stream came down through the rift wall. He did not think we could get the loads through. We gave it up. â€˜Thatâ€™s the sort of trip to make, though,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Porters donâ€™t cost as much as petrol.â€™ â€˜Canâ€™t we make trips like that when we come back?â€™ P.O.M. asked. â€˜Yes,â€™ Pop said. â€˜But for a big rhino you want to go up on Mount Kenya. Youâ€™ll get a real one there. Kuduâ€™s the prize here. Youâ€™d have to go up to Kalal to get one in Kenya. Then if we get them, weâ€™ll have time to go on down in that Handeni country for sable.â€™ â€˜Letâ€™s get going,â€™ I said without moving. Since a long time we had all felt good about Karlâ€™s rhino. We were glad he had it and all of that had taken on a correct perspective. Maybe he had his oryx by now. I hoped so. He was a fine fellow, Karl, and it was good he got these extra fine heads. â€˜How do you feel, poor old Mama?â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m fine. If we are going Iâ€™ll be just as glad to rest my feet. But I love this kind of hunting.â€™ â€˜Letâ€™s get back, eat, break camp, and get down there to-night.â€™ That night we got into our old camp at Mâ€™utu-Umbu, under the big trees, not far from the road. It had been our first camp in Africa and the trees were as big, as spreading, and as green, the stream as clear and fast flowing, and the camp as fine as when we had first been there. The only difference was that now it was hotter at night, the road in was hub-deep in dust, and we had seen a lot of country. CHAPTER FOUR We had come down to the Rift Valley by a sandy red road across a high plateau, then up and down through orchard-bushed hills, around a slope of forest to the top of the rift wall where we could look down and see the plain, the heavy forest below the wall, and the long, dried-up edged shine of Lake Manyara rose-coloured at one end with a half million tiny dots that were flamingoes. From there the road dropped steeply along the face of the wall, down into the forest, on to the flatness of the valley, through cultivated patches of green corn, bananas, and trees I did not know the names of, walled thick with forest, past a Hinduâ€™s trading store and many huts, over two bridges where clear, fast-flowing streams ran, through more forest, thinning now to open glades, and into a dusty turn-off that led into a deeply rutted, dust-filled track through bushes to the shade of Mâ€™utu-Umbu camp. That night after dinner we heard the flamingoes flighting in the dark. It was like the sound the wings of ducks make as they go over before it is light, but slower, with a steady beat, and multiplied a thousand times. Pop and I were a little drunk and P.O.M. was very tired. Karl was gloomy again. We had taken the edge from his victories over rhino and now that was past anyway and he was facing possible defeat by oryx. Then, too, they had found not a leopard but a marvellous lion, a huge, black-maned lion that did not want to leave, on the rhino carcass when they had gone there the next morning and could not shoot him because he was in some sort of forest reserve. â€˜Thatâ€™s rotten,â€™ I said and I tried to feel bad about it but I was still feeling much too good to appreciate any one elseâ€™s gloom, and Pop and I sat, tired through to our bones, drinking whisky and soda and talking. The next day we hunted oryx in the dried-up dustiness of the Rift Valley and finally found a herd way off at the edge of the wooded hills on the far side above a Masai village. They were like a bunch of Masai donkeys except for the beautiful straight-slanting black horns and all the heads looked good. When you looked closely two or three were obviously better than the others and sitting on the ground I picked what I thought was the very best of the lot and as they strung out I made sure of this one. I heard the bullet smack and watched the oryx circle out away from the others, the circle quickening, and knew I had it. So I did not shoot again. This was the one Karl had picked, too. I did not know that, but had shot, deliberately selfish, to make sure of the best this time at least, but he got another good one and they went off in a wind-lifted cloud of grey dust as they galloped. Except for the miracle of their horns there was no more excitement in shooting them than if they had been donkeys, and after the lorry came up and Mâ€™Cola and Charo had skinned the heads out and cut up the meat we rode home in the blowing dust, our faces grey with it, and the valley one long heat mirage. We stayed at that camp two days. We had to get some zebra hides that we had promised friends at home and it needed time for the skinner to handle them properly. Getting the zebra was no fun; the plain was dull, now that the grass had dried, hot and dusty after the hills, and the picture that remains is of sitting against an ant hill with, in the distance, a herd of zebra galloping in the grey heat haze, raising a dust, and on the yellow plain, the birds circling over a white patch there, another beyond, there a third, and looking back, the plume of dust of the lorry coming with the skinners and the men to cut up the meat for the village. I did some bad shooting in the heat on a Grantâ€™s gazelle that the volunteer skinners asked me to kill them for meat, wounding him in a running shot after missing him three or four times, and then following him across the plain until almost noon in that heat until I got within range and killed him. But that afternoon we went out along the road that ran through the settlement and past the corner of the Hinduâ€™s general store, where he smiled at us in well-oiled, unsuccessful-storekeeping, brotherly humanity, and hopeful salesmanship, turned the car off to the left on to a track that went into the deep forest, a narrow brush-bordered track through the heavy timber, that crossed a stream on an unsound log and pole bridge and went on until the timber thinned and we came out into a grassy savannah that stretched ahead to the reed-edged, dried-up bed of the lake with, far beyond, the shine of the water and the rose-pink of the flamingoes. There were some grass huts of fishermen in the shade of the last trees and ahead the wind blew across the grass of the savannah and the dried bed of the lake showed a white-grey with many small animals humping across its baked surface as our car alarmed them. They were reed buck and they looked strange and awkward as they moved in the distance but trim and graceful as you saw them standing close. We turned the car out through the thick, short grass and on to the dried lake floor and everywhere, to the left and to the right, where the streams flowed out into the lake and made a reedy marsh that ran down toward the receded lake, cut by canals of water, ducks were flying and we could see big flocks of geese spread over the grassy hummocks that rose above the marsh. The dried bed was hard and firm and we drove the car until it commenced to look moist and soft ahead, then left the motor car standing there, and, Karl taking Charo and I, Mâ€™Cola, to carry shells and birds, we agreed to work one on one side and one the other of the marsh and try to shoot and keep the birds moving while Pop and P.O.M. went into the edge of the high reeds on the left shore of the lake where another stream made a thick marsh to which we thought the ducks might fly. We saw them walk across the open, a big bulky figure in a faded corduroy coat and a very small one in trousers, grey khaki jacket, boots, and a big hat, and then disappear as they crouched in a point of dried reeds before we started. But as we went out to reach the edge of the stream we soon saw the plan was no good. Even watch at the same time Pop did, we cut down three that fell hard in a long slant ahead in the tall grass. We hunted carefully and found them all. Their speed had carried them much farther than we expected and then, almost dark now, we started for the car across the grey dried mud of the lake bed, me soaked and my boots squashing water, P.O.M. pleased with the ducks, the first weâ€™d had since the Serengetti, we all remembering how marvellous they were to eat, and ahead we could see the car looking very small and beyond it a stretch of flat, baked mud and then the grassy savannah and the forest. Next day we came in from the zebra business grey and sweat-caked with dust that the car raised and the wind blew over us on the way home across the plain. P.O.M. and Pop had not gone out, there was nothing for them to do and no need for them to eat that dust, and Karl and I out on the plain in the too much sun and dust had gone through one of those rows that starts like this, â€˜What was the matter?â€™ â€˜They were too far.â€™ â€˜Not at the start.â€™ â€˜They were too far, I tell you.â€™ â€˜They get hard if you donâ€™t take them.â€™ â€˜You shoot them.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ve got enough. We only want twelve hides altogether. You go ahead.â€™ Then someone, angry, shooting too fast to show he was being asked to shoot too fast, getting up from behind the ant hill and turning away in disgust, walking towards his partner, who says, smugly, â€˜Whatâ€™s the matter with them?â€™ â€˜Theyâ€™re too damned far, I tell you,â€™ desperately. The smug one, complacently, â€˜Look at themâ€™. The zebra that had galloped off had seen the approaching lorry of the skinners and had circled and were standing now, broadside, in easy range. The one looks, says nothing, too angry now to shoot. Then says, â€˜Go ahead. Shootâ€™. The smug one, more righteous now than ever, refuses. â€˜Go ahead,â€™ he says. â€˜Iâ€™m through,â€™ says the other. He knows he is too angry to shoot and he feels he has been tricked. Something is always tricking him, the need to do things other than in a regular order, or by an inexact command in which details are not specified, or to have to do it in front of people, or to be hurried. â€˜Weâ€™ve got eleven,â€™ says smug face, sorry now. He knows he should not hurry him, that he should leave him alone, that he only upsets him by trying to speed him up, and that he has been a smugly righteous bastard again. â€˜We can pick up the other one any time. Come on, Bo, weâ€™ll go in.â€™ â€˜No, letâ€™s get him. You get him.â€™ â€˜No, letâ€™s go in.â€™ And as the car comes up and you ride in through the dust the bitterness goes and there is only the feeling of shortness of time again. â€˜What you thinking about now?â€™ you ask. â€˜What a son of a bitch I am, still?â€™ â€˜About this afternoon,â€™ he says and grins, making wrinkles in the caked dust on his face. â€˜Me too,â€™ you say. Finally the afternoon comes and you start. This time you wear canvas ankle-high shoes, light to pull out when you sink, you work out from hummock to hummock, picking a way across the marsh and wade and flounder through the canals and the ducks fly as before out to the lake, but you make a long circle to the right and come out into the lake itself and find the bottom hard and firm and walking knee deep in the water get outside the big flocks, then there is a shot and you and Mâ€™Cola crouch, heads bent, and then the air is full of them, and you cut down two, then two again, and then a high one straight overhead, then miss a fast one straight and low to the right, then they come whistling back, passing faster than you can load and shoot, you brown a bunch to get cripples for decoys and then take only fancy shots because you know now you can get all that we can use or carry. You try the high one, straight overhead and almost leaning backward, the coup de roi, and splash a big black duck down beside Mâ€™Cola, him laughing, then, the four cripples swimming away, you decide you better kill them and pick up. You have to run in water to your knees to get in range of the last cripple and you slip and go face down and are sitting, enjoying being completely wet finally, water cool on your behind, soaked with muddy water, wiping off glasses, and then getting the water out of the gun, wondering if you can shoot up the shells before they will swell, Mâ€™Cola delighted with the spill. He, with the shooting coat now full of ducks, crouches and a flock of geese pass over in easy range while you try to pump a wet shell in. You get a shell in, shoot, but it is too far, or you were behind, and at the shot you see the cloud of flamingoes rise in the sun, making the whole horizon of the lake pink. Then they settle. But after that each time after you shoot you turn and look out into the sun on the water and see that quick rise of the unbelievable cloud and then the slow settling. â€˜Mâ€™Cola,â€™ you say and point. â€˜Nâ€™Dio,â€™ he says, watching them. â€˜Mâ€™uzuri!â€™ and hands you more shells. We all had good shooting but it was best out on the lake and for three days afterward, travelling, we had cold teal, the best of ducks to eat, fine, plump, and tender, cold with Pan-Yan pickles, and the red wine we bought at Babati, sitting by the road waiting for the lorries to come up, sitting on the shady porch of the little hotel at Babati, then late at night when the lorries finally came in and we were at the house of an absent friend of a friend high up in the hills, cold at night, wearing coats at the table, having waited so long for the broken-down lorry to come that we all drank much too much and were unspeakably hungry, P.O.M. dancing with the manager of the coffee shamba, and with Karl, to the gramophone, me shot full of emetine and with a ringing headache drowning it successfully in whisky-soda with Pop on the porch, it dark and the wind blowing a gale, and then those teal coming on the table, smoking hot and with fresh vegetables. Guinea hen were all right, and I had one now in the lunch box in the back of the car that I would eat to-night; but those teal were the finest of all. From Babati we had driven through the hills to the edge of a plain, wooded in a long stretch of glade beyond a small village where there was a mission station at the foot of a mountain. Here we had made a camp to hunt kudu which were supposed to be in the wooded hills and in the forests on the flats that stretched out to the edge of the open plain. CHAPTER FIVE It was a hot place to camp, under trees that had been girdled to kill them so that the tsetse fly would leave, and there was hard hunting in the hills, which were steep, brushy, and very broken, with a hard climb before you got up into them, and easy hunting on the wooded flats where you wandered as though through a deer park. But everywhere were tsetse flies, swarming around you, biting hard on your neck, through your shirt, on arms, and behind the ears. I carried a leafy branch and swished away at the back of my neck as we walked and we hunted five days, from daylight until dark, coming home after dark, dead tired but glad of the coolness and relieve him but I could see, now that he was tired he felt they probably were in the hills and he was missing his chance. In the five days I saw a dozen or more kudu cows and one young bull with a string of cows. The cows were big, grey, striped-flanked antelope with ridiculously small heads, big ears, and a soft, fast-rushing gait that moved them in big-bellied panic through the trees. The young bull had the start of a spiral on his horns but they were short and dumpy and as he ran past us at the end of a glade in the dusk, third in a string of six cows, he was no more like a real bull than a spike elk is like a big, old, thick-necked, dark-maned, wonder-horned, tawny-hided, beer-horse-built bugler of a bull-elk. Another time, headed home as the sun went down along a steep valley in the hills, the guides pointed to two grey, white-striped, moving animals, against the sun at the top of the hill, showing only their flanks through the trunks of the trees and said they were kudu bulls. We could not see the horns and when we got up to the top of the hill the sun was gone and on the rocky ground we could not find their tracks. But from the glimpse we had they looked higher in the legs than the cows we saw and they might have been bulls. We hunted the ridges until dark but never saw them again nor did Karl find them the next day when we sent him there. We jumped many waterbuck and once, still hunting along a ridge with a steep gully below, we came on a waterbuck that had heard us, but not scented us, and as we stood, perfectly quiet, Mâ€™Cola holding his hand on mine, we watched him, only a dozen feet away, standing, beautiful, dark, full-necked, a dark ruff on his neck, his horns up, trembling all over as his nostrils widened searching for the scent. Mâ€™Cola was grinning, pressing his fingers tight on my wrist and we watched the big buck shiver from the danger that he could not locate. Then there was the distant, heavy boom of a native black powder gun and the buck jumped and almost ran over us as he crashed up the ridge. Another day, with P.O.M. along, we had hunted all through the timbered flat and come out to the edge of the plain where there were only clumps of bush and sanseviera when we heard a deep, throaty, cough. I looked at Mâ€™Cola. â€˜Simba,â€™ he said, and did not look pleased. â€˜Wapi?â€™ I whispered. â€˜Where?â€™ He pointed. I whispered to P.O.M., â€˜Itâ€™s a lion. Probably the one we heard early this morning. You go back to those trees.â€™ We had heard a lion roaring just before daylight when we were getting up. â€˜Iâ€™d rather stay with you.â€™ â€˜It wouldnâ€™t be fair to Pop,â€™ I said. â€˜You wait back there.â€™ â€˜All right. But you will be careful.â€™ â€˜I wonâ€™t take anything but a standing shot and I wonâ€™t shoot unless Iâ€™m sure of him.â€™ â€˜All right.â€™ â€˜Come on,â€™ I said to Mâ€™Cola. He looked very grave and did not like it at all. â€˜Wapi Simba?â€™ I whispered. â€˜Here,â€™ he said dismally and pointed at the broken islands of thick, green spiky cover. I motioned to one of the guides to go back with P.O.M. and we watched them go back a couple of hundred yards to the edge of the forest. â€˜Come on,â€™ I said. Mâ€™Cola shook his head without smiling but followed. We went forward very slowly, looking into and trying to see through the senseviera. We could see nothing. Then we heard the cough again, a little ahead and to the right. â€˜No!â€™ Mâ€™Cola whispered. â€™Hapana, Bâ€™wana!â€™ â€˜Come on,â€™ I said. I pointed my forefinger into my neck and wriggled the thumb down. â€˜Kufa,â€™ I whispered, meaning that I would shoot the lion in the neck and kill him dead. Mâ€™Cola shook his head, his face grave and sweating. â€˜Hapana!â€™ he whispered. There was an ant-hill ahead and we climbed the furrowed clay and from the top looked all around. We could not make out anything in the green cactus-like cover. I had believed we might see him from the ant-hill and after we came down we went on for about two hundred yards into the broken cactus. Once again we heard him cough ahead of us and once, a little farther on, we heard a growl. It was very deep and very impressive. Since the ant heap my heart had not been in it. Until that had failed I had believed I might have a close and good shot and I knew that if I could kill one alone, without Pop along, I would feel good about it for a long time. I had made up my mind absolutely not to shoot unless I knew I could kill him, I had killed three and knew what it consisted in, but I was getting more excitement from this one than the whole trip. I felt it was perfectly fair to Pop to take it on as long as I had a chance to call the shot but what we were getting into now was bad. He kept moving away as we came on, but slowly. Evidently he did not want to move, having fed, probably, when we had heard him roaring in the early morning, and he wanted to settle down now. Mâ€™Cola hated it. How much of it was the responsibility he felt for me to Pop and how much was his own acute feeling of misery about the dangerous game I did not know. But he felt very miserable. Finally he put his hand on my shoulder, put his face almost into mine and shook his head violently three times. â€˜Hapana! Hapana! Hapana! Bâ€™wana!â€™ he protested, sorrowed, and pleaded. After all, I had no business taking him where I could not call the shot and it was a profound personal relief to turn back. â€˜All right,â€™ I said. We turned around and came back out the same way we had gone in, then crossed the open prairie to the trees where P.O.M. was waiting. â€˜Did you see him?â€™ â€˜No,â€™ I told her. â€˜We heard him three or four times.â€™ â€˜Werenâ€™t you frightened?â€™ â€˜Pea-less,â€™ I said, â€˜at the last. But Iâ€™d rather have shot him in there than any damned thing in the world.â€™ â€˜My, Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re back,â€™ she said. I got the dictionary out of my pocket and made a sentence in pigeon Swahili. â€˜Likeâ€™ was the word I wanted. â€˜Mâ€™Cola like Simba?â€™ Mâ€™Cola could grin again now and the smile moved the Chinese hairs at the corner of his mouth. â€˜Hapana,â€™ he said, and waved his hand in front of his face. â€˜Hapana!â€™ â€˜Hapanaâ€™ is a negative. â€˜Shoot a kudu?â€™ I suggested. â€˜Good,â€™ said Mâ€™Cola feelingly in Swahili. â€˜Better. Best. Tendalla, yes. Tendalla.â€™ But we never saw a kudu bull out of that camp and we left two days later to go into Babati and then down to Kondoa and strike across country toward Handeni and the coast. I never liked that camp, nor the guides, nor the country. It had that picked-over, shot-out feeling. We knew there were kudu there and the Prince of Wales had killed his kudu from that camp, but there had been three other parties in that season, and the natives were hunting, supposedly defending their crops from baboons, but on meeting a native with a brass-bound musket it seemed odd that he should follow the baboons ten miles away from his shamba up into the kudu hills to have a shot at them, and I was all for pulling out and trying the new country toward Handeni where none of us had ever been. â€˜Letâ€™s go then,â€™ Pop said. It seemed this new country was a gift. Kudu came out into the open and you sat and waited for the more enormous ones and selecting a suitable head, blasted him over. Then there were sable and we agreed that whoever killed the first kudu should move on in the sable country. I was beginning to feel awfully good and Karl was very cheerful at the prospect of this new miraculous country where they were so unsophisticated that it was really a shame to topple them over. We left, soon after daylight, ahead of the outfit, who were to strike camp and follow in the two lorries. We stopped in Babati at the little hotel overlooking the lake and bought some more Pan-Yan pickles and had some cold beer. Then we started south on the Cape to Cairo road, here well graded, smooth, and carefully cut through wooded hills overlooking the long yellow stretch of plains of the Masai Steppes, down and through farming country, where the dried-breasted old women and the shrunken-flanked, hollow-ribbed old men hoed in the cornfields, through miles and dusty miles of this, and then into a valley of sun-baked, eroded land where the soil was blowing away in clouds as you looked, into the tree-shaded, pretty, whitewashed, German model-garrison town of Kandoa-Irangi. We left Mâ€™Cola at the crossroads to hold up our lorries when they came, put the car into some shade and visited the military cemetery. We intended to call on the D.O. but they were at lunch, and we did not want to bother them, so after the military cemetery, which was a pleasant, clean, well-kept place and as good as another to be dead in, we had some beer under a tree in shade that seemed liquid cool after the white glare of a sun that you could feel the weight of on your neck and shoulders, started the car and went out to the crossroads to pick up the lorries and head to the east into the new country. CHAPTER SIX It was a new country to us but it had the marks of the oldest countries. The road was a track over shelves of solid rock, worn by the feet of the caravans and the cattle, and it rose in the boulder-strewn un-roadliness through a double line of trees and into the hills. The country was so much like Aragon that I could not believe that we were not in Spain until, instead of mules with saddle bags, we met a dozen natives bare-legged and bare-headed dressed in white cotton cloth they wore gathered over the shoulder like a toga; but when they had passed, the high trees beside the track over those rocks was Spain and I had followed this same route forged on ahead and following close behind a horse one time watching the horror of the flies scuttling around his crupper. They were the same camel flies we found here on the lions. In Spain if one got inside your shirt you had to get the shirt off to kill him. Heâ€™d go inside the neckband, down the back, around and under one arm, make for the navel and the belly band, and if you did not get him he would move with such intelligence and speed that, scuttling flat and uncrushable he would make you undress completely to kill him. That day of watching the camel flies working under the horseâ€™s tail, having had them myself, gave me more horror than anything I could remember except one time in a hospital with my right arm broken off short between the elbow and the shoulder, the back of the hand having hung down against my back, the points of the bone having cut up the flesh of the biceps until it finally rotted, swelled, burst, and sloughed off in pus. Alone with the pain in the night in the fifth week of not sleeping I thought suddenly how a bull elk must feel if you break a shoulder and he gets away and in that night I lay and felt it all, the whole thing as it would happen from the shock of the bullet to the end of the business and, being a little out of my head, thought perhaps what I was going through was a punishment for all hunters. Then, getting well, decided if it was a punishment I had paid it and at least I knew what I was doing. I did nothing that had not been done to me. I had been shot and I had been crippled and gotten away. I expected, always, to be killed by one thing or another and I, truly, did not mind that any more. Since I still loved to hunt I resolved that I would only shoot as long as I could kill cleanly and as soon as I lost that ability I would stop. If you serve time for society, democracy, and the other things quite young, and declining any further enlistment make yourself responsible only to yourself, you exchange the pleasant, comforting stench of comrades for something you can never feel in any other way than by yourself. That something I cannot yet define completely but the feeling comes when you write well and truly of something and know impersonally you have written in that way and those who are paid to read it and report on viewpoint; the stream, with no visible flow, takes five loads of this a day when things are going well in La Habana and in ten miles along the coast it is as clear and blue and unimpressed as it was ever before the tug hauled out the scow; and the palm fronds of our victories, the worn light bulbs of our discoveries and the empty condoms of our great loves float with no significance against one single, lasting thingâ€”the stream. So, in the front seat, thinking of the sea and of the country, in a little while we ran out of Aragon and down to the bank of a sand river, half a mile wide, of golden-coloured sand, shored by green trees and broken by islands of timber and in this river the water is underneath the sand and the game comes down at night and digs in the sand with sharp-pointed hoofs and water flows in and they drink. We cross this river and by now it was getting to be afternoon and we passed many people on the road who were leaving the country ahead where there was a famine and there were small trees and close brush now beside the road, and then it commenced to climb and we came into some blue hills, old, worn, wooded hills with trees like beeches and clusters of huts with fire smoking and cattle home driven, flocks of sheep and goats and patches of corn and I said to P.O.M., â€˜Itâ€™s like Galiciaâ€™. â€˜Exactly,â€™ she said. â€˜Weâ€™ve been through three provinces of Spain to-day.â€™ â€˜Is it really?â€™ Pop asked. â€˜Thereâ€™s no difference,â€™ I said. â€˜Only the buildings. It was like Navarre in Droopyâ€™s country too. The limestone outcropping in the same way, the way the land lies, the trees along the watercourses and the springs.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s damned strange how you can love a country,â€™ Pop said. â€˜You two are very profound fellows,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜But where are we going to camp?â€™ â€˜Here,â€™ said Pop. â€˜As well as any place. Weâ€™ll just find some water.â€™ We camped under some trees near three big wells where native women came for water and, after drawing lots for location, Karl and I hunted in the dusk around two of the hills across the road above the native village. â€˜Itâ€™s all kudu country,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Youâ€™re liable to jump one anywhere.â€™ But we saw nothing but some Masai cattle in the timber and came home, in the dark, glad of the walk after a day in the car, to find camp up, Pop and P.O.M. in pyjamas by the fire, and Karl not yet in. He came in, furious for some reason, no kudu possibly, pale, and gaunt looking and speaking to nobody. Later, at the fire, he asked me where we had gone and I said we had hunted around our hill until our guide had heard them; then cut up to the top of the hill, down, and across country to camp. â€˜What do you mean, heard us?â€™ â€˜He said he heard you. So did Mâ€™Cola.â€™ â€˜I thought we drew lots for where we would hunt.â€™ â€˜We did,â€™ I said. â€˜But we didnâ€™t know we had gotten around to your side until we heard you.â€™ â€˜Did you hear us?â€™ â€˜I heard something,â€™ I said. â€˜And when I put my hand up to my ear to listen the guide said something to Mâ€™Cola and Mâ€™Cola said, â€œBâ€™wanaâ€. I said, â€œWhat Bâ€™wana?â€ and he said, â€œBâ€™wana Kaborâ€. Thatâ€™s you. So we figured weâ€™d come to our limit and went up to the top and came back.â€™ He said nothing and looked very angry. â€˜Donâ€™t get sore about it,â€™ I said. â€˜Iâ€™m not sore. Iâ€™m tired,â€™ he said. I could believe it because of all people no one can be gentler, more understanding, more self-sacrificing, than Karl, but the kudu had become an obsession to him and he was not himself, nor anything like himself. â€˜He better get one pretty quick,â€™ P.O.M. said when he had gone into his tent to bathe. â€˜Did you cut in on his country?â€™ Pop asked me. â€˜Hell, no,â€™ I said. â€˜Heâ€™ll get one where weâ€™re going,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Heâ€™ll probably get a fifty-incher.â€™ â€˜All the better,â€™ I said. â€˜But by God, I want to get one too.â€™ â€˜You will, Old Timer,â€™ Pop said. â€˜I havenâ€™t a thought but what you will.â€™ â€˜What the hell! Weâ€™ve got ten days.â€™ â€˜Weâ€™ll get sable too, youâ€™ll see. Once our luck starts to run.â€™ â€˜How long have you ever had them hunt them in a good country?â€™ â€˜Three weeks and leave without seeing one. And Iâ€™ve had them get them the first half day. Itâ€™s still hunting, the way you hunt a big buck at home.â€™ â€˜I love it,â€™ I said. â€˜But I donâ€™t want that guy to beat me. Pop, heâ€™s got the best buff, the best rhino, the best water-buck . . .â€™ â€˜You beat him on oryx,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Whatâ€™s an oryx?â€™ â€˜Heâ€™ll look damned handsome when you get him home.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m just kidding.â€™ â€˜You beat him on impalla, on eland. Youâ€™ve got a first-rate bushbuck. Your leopardâ€™s as good as his. But heâ€™ll beat you on anything where thereâ€™s luck. Heâ€™s got damned wonderful luck and heâ€™s a good lad. I think heâ€™s off his feed a little.â€™ â€˜You know how fond I am of him. I like him as well as I like anyone. But I want to see him have a good time. Itâ€™s no fun to hunt if we get that way about it.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™ll see. Heâ€™ll get a kudu at this next camp and heâ€™ll be on top of the wave.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m just a crabby bastard,â€™ I said. â€˜Of course you are,â€™ said Pop. â€˜But why not have a drink?â€™ â€˜Right,â€™ I said. Karl came out, quiet, friendly, gentle, and understandingly delicate. â€˜It will be fine when we get to that new country,â€™ he said. â€˜It will be swell,â€™ I said. â€˜Tell me what itâ€™s like, Mr. Phillips,â€™ he said to Pop. â€˜I donâ€™t know,â€™ said Pop. â€˜But they say itâ€™s very pleasant hunting. Theyâ€™re supposed to feed right out in the open. That old Dutchman claims there are some remarkable heads.â€™ â€˜I hope you get a sixty-incher, kid,â€™ Karl said to me. â€˜Youâ€™ll get a sixty-incher.â€™ â€˜No,â€™ said Karl. â€˜Donâ€™t kid me. Iâ€™ll be happy with any kudu.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™ll probably get a hell of a one,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Donâ€™t kid me,â€™ Karl said. â€˜I know how lucky Iâ€™ve been. I would be happy with any kudu. Any bull at all.â€™ He was very gentle and he could tell what was in your mind, forgive you for it, and understand it. â€˜Good old Karl,â€™ I said, warmed with whisky, understanding, and sentiment. â€˜Weâ€™re having a swell time, arenâ€™t we?â€™ Karl said. â€˜Whereâ€™s poor old Mama?â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m here,â€™ said P.O.M. from the shadow. â€˜Iâ€™m one of those quiet people.â€™ â€˜By God if youâ€™re not,â€™ Pop said. â€˜But you can puncture the old man quick enough when he gets started.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s what makes a woman a universal favourite,â€™ P.O.M. told him. â€˜Give me another compliment, Mr. J.â€™ â€˜By God, youâ€™re brave as a little terrier.â€™ Pop and I had both been drinking, it seemed. â€˜Thatâ€™s lovely.â€™ P.O.M. sat far back in her chair, holding her hands clasped around her mosquito boots. I looked at her, seeing her quilted blue robe in the firelight now, and the light on her black hair. â€˜I love it when you all reach the little terrier stage. Then I know the war canâ€™t be far away. Were either of you gentlemen in the war by any chance?â€™ â€˜Not me,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Your husband, one of the bravest bastards that ever lived, an extraordinary wing shot and an excellent tracker.â€™ â€˜Now heâ€™s drunk, we get the truth,â€™ I said. â€˜Letâ€™s eat,â€™ said P.O.M. â€˜Iâ€™m really frightfully hungry.â€™ We were out in the car at daylight, out on to the road and beyond the village and, passing through a stretch of heavy bush, we came to the edge of a plain, still misty before the sunrise, where we could see, a long way off, eland feeding, looking huge and grey in the early morning light. We stopped the car at the edge of the bush and getting out and sitting down with the glasses saw there was a herd of kongoni scattered between us and the eland and with the kongoni a single bull oryx, like a fat, plum-coloured, Masai donkey with marvellous long, black, straight, back-slanting horns that showed each time he lifted his head from feeding. â€˜You want to go after him?â€™ I asked Karl. â€˜No. You go on.â€™ I knew he hated to make a stalk and to shoot in front of people and so I said, â€˜All rightâ€™. Also I wanted to shoot, selfishly, and Karl was unselfish. We wanted meat badly. I walked along the road, not looking toward the game, trying to look casual, holding the rifle slung straight up and down from the left shoulder away from the game. They seemed to pay no attention but fed away steadily. I knew that if I moved toward them they would at once move off out of range so, when from the tail of my eye I saw the oryx drop his head to feed again, and, the shot looking possible, I sat down, slipped my arm through the sling and as he looked up and started to move off, quartering away, I held for the top of his back and squeezed off. You do not hear the noise of the shot on game but the slap of the bullet sounded as he started running across and to the right, the whole plain back-grounding into moving animals against the rise of the sun, the rocking-horse canter of the long-legged, grotesque kongoni, the heavy swinging trot into gallop of the eland, and another oryx I had not seen before running with the kongoni. This sudden life and panic all made background for the one I wanted, now trotting, three-quartering away, his horns held high now and I stood to shoot running, got on him, the whole animal miniatured in the aperture and I held above his shoulders, swung ahead and squeezed and he was down, kicking, before the crack of the bullet striking bone came back. It was a very long and even more lucky shot that broke a hind leg. I ran toward him, then slowed to walk up carefully, in order not to be blown if he jumped and ran; but he was down for good. He had gone down so suddenly and the bullet had made such a crack as it landed that I was afraid I had hit him on the horns but when I reached him he was dead from the first shot behind the shoulders high up in the back and I saw it was cutting the leg from under him that brought him down. They all came up and Charo stuck him to make him legal meat. â€˜Where did you hold on him the second time?â€™ Karl asked. â€˜Nowhere. A touch above and quite a way ahead and swung with him.â€™ â€˜It was very pretty,â€™ Dan said. â€˜By evening,â€™ Pop said, â€˜heâ€™ll tell us that he broke that off leg on purpose. Thatâ€™s one of his favourite shots, you know. Did you ever hear him explain it?â€™ While Mâ€™Cola was skinning the head out and Charo was butchering out the meat, a long, thin Masai with a spear came up, said good morning, and stood, on one leg, watching the skinning. He spoke to me at some length, and I called to Pop. The Masai repeated it to Pop. â€˜He wants to know if you are going to shoot something else,â€™ Pop said. â€˜He would like some hides but he doesnâ€™t care about oryx hide. It is almost worthless, he says. He wonders if you would like to shoot a couple of kongoni or an eland. He likes those hides.â€™ â€˜Tell him on our way back.â€™ Pop told him solemnly. The Masai shook my hand. â€˜Tell him he can always find me around Harryâ€™s New York Bar,â€™ I said. The Masai said something else and scratched one leg with the other. â€˜He says why did you shoot him twice?â€™ Pop asked. â€˜Tell him in the morning in our tribe we always shoot them twice. Later in the day we shoot them once. In the evening we are often half shot ourselves. Tell him he can always find me at the New Stanley or at Torrâ€™s.â€™ â€˜He says what do you do with the horns?â€™ â€˜Tell him in our tribe we give the horns to our wealthiest friends. Tell him it is very exciting and sometimes members of the tribe are chased across vast spaces with empty pistols. Tell him he can find me in the book.â€™ Pop told the Masai something and we shook hands again, parting on a most excellent basis. Looking across the plain through the mist we could see some other Masai coming along the road; earth-brown skins, and knee-ing forward stride and spears thin in the morning light. Back in the car, the oryx head wrapped in a burlap sack, the meat tied inside the mudguards, the blood drying, the meat dusting over, the road of red sand now, the plain gone, the bush again close to the edge of the road, we came up into some hills and through the little village of Kibaya where there was a white rest house and a general store and much farming land. It was here Dan had sat on a haystack one time waiting for a kudu to feed out into the edge of a patch of mealy-corn and a lion had stalked Dan while he sat and nearly gotten him. This gave us a strong historical feeling for the village of Kibaya and as it was still cool and the sun had not yet burned off the dew from the grass I suggested we drink a bottle of that silver-paper-necked, yellow-and-black-labelled German beer with the horseman in armour on it in order that we might remember the place better and even appreciate it more. This done, full of historical admiration for Kibaya, we learned the road was possible ahead, left word for the lorries to follow on to the eastward and headed on toward the coast and the kudu country. For a long time, while the sun rose and the day became hot we drove through what Pop had described, when I asked him what the country was like to the south, as a million miles of bloody Africa, bush close to the road that was impenetrable, solid, scrubby-looking undergrowth. â€˜There are very big elephant in there,â€™ Pop said. â€˜But itâ€™s impossible to hunt them. Thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re very big. Simple, isnâ€™t it?â€™ After a long stretch of the million-mile country, the country began to open out into dry, sandy, bush-bordered prairies that dried into a typical desert country with occasional patches of bush where there was water, that Pop said was like the northern frontier province of Kenya. We watched for gerenuk, that long-necked antelope that resembles a praying mantis in its way of carrying itself, and for the lesser kudu that we knew lived in this desert bush, but the sun was high now and we saw nothing. Finally the road began to lift gradually into the hills again, low, blue, wooded hills now, with miles of sparse bush, a little thicker than orchard bush, between, and ahead a pair of high, heavy, timbered hills that were big enough to be mountains. These were on each side of the road and as we climbed in the car where the red road narrowed there was a herd of hundreds of cattle ahead being driven down to the coast by Somali cattle buyers; the principal buyer walked ahead, tall, good-looking in white turban and coast clothing, carrying an umbrella as a symbol of authority. We worked the car through the herd, finally, and coming out wound our way through pleasant looking bush, up and out into the open between the two mountains and on, half a mile, to a mud and thatched village in the open clearing on a little low plateau beyond the two mountains. Looking back, the mountains looked very fine and with timber up their slopes, outcroppings of limestone and open glades and meadows above the timber. â€˜Is this the place?â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ said Dan. â€˜We will find where the camping place is.â€™ A very old, worn, and faded black man, with a stubble of white beard, a farmer, dressed in a dirty once-white cloth gathered at the shoulder in the manner of a Roman toga, came out from behind one of the mud and wattle huts, and guided us back down the road and off it to the left to a very good camp site. He was a very discouraged-looking old man and after Pop and Dan had talked with him he went off, seeming more discouraged than before, to bring some guides whose names Dan had written on a piece of paper as being recommended by a Dutch hunter who had been here a year ago and who was Danâ€™s great friend. We took the seats out of the car to use as a table and benches, and spreading our coats to sit on had a lunch in the deep shade of a big tree, drank some beer, and slept or read while we waited for the lorries to come up. Before the lorries arrived the old man came back with the skinniest, hungriest, most unsuccessful looking of Wanderobos who stood on one leg, scratched the back of his neck and carried a bow and quiver of arrows and a spear. Queried as to whether this was the guide whose name we had, the old man admitted he was not and went off more discouraged than ever, to get the official guides. When we woke next the old man was standing with the two official and highly-clothed-in-khaki guides and two others, quite naked, from the village. There was a long palaver and the head one of the two khaki-panted guides showed his credentials, a To Whom It May Concern, stating the bearer knew the country well and was a reliable boy and capable tracker. This was signed by so and so, professional hunter. The khaki-clothed guide referred to this professional hunter as Bâ€™wana Simba and the name infuriated us all. â€˜Some bloke that killed a lion once,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Tell him I am Bâ€™wana Fisi, the hyena slaughterer,â€™ I told Dan. â€˜Bâ€™wana Fisi chokes them with his naked hands.â€™ Dan was telling them something else. â€˜Ask them if they would like to meet Bâ€™wana Hop-Toad, the inventor of the hoptoads and Mama Tziggi, who owns all these locusts.â€™ Dan ignored this. It seemed they were discussing money. After ascertaining their customary daily wage, Pop told them if either of us killed a kudu the guide would receive fifteen shillings. â€˜You mean a pound,â€™ said the leading guide. â€˜They seem to know what theyâ€™re up to,â€™ Pop said. â€˜I must say I donâ€™t care for this sportsman in spite of what Bâ€™wana Simba says.â€™ Bâ€™wana Simba, by the way, we later found out to be an excellent hunter with a wonderful reputation on the coast. â€˜Weâ€™ll put them into two lots and you draw from them,â€™ Pop suggested, â€˜one naked one and one with breeches in each lot. Iâ€™m all for the naked savage, myself, as a guide.â€™ On suggesting to the two testimonial-equipped, breeched guides that they select an unclothed partner, we found this would not work out. Loud Mouth, the financial and, now, theatrical, genius who was giving a gesture-by-gesture reproduction of How Bâ€™wana Simba Killed His Last Kudu interrupted it long enough to state he would only hunt with Abdullah. Abdullah, the short, thick-nosed, educated one, was His Tracker. They always hunted together. He himself did not track. He resumed the pantomime of Bâ€™wana Simba and another character known as Bâ€™wana Doktor and the horned beasts. â€˜Weâ€™ll take the two savages as one lot and these two Oxonians as the other,â€™ Pop said. â€˜I hate that theatrical bastard,â€™ I said. â€˜He may be marvellous,â€™ Pop said doubtfully. Anyway, youâ€™re a tracker, you know. The old man says the other two are good.â€™ â€˜Thank you. Go to hell. Will you hold the straws?â€™ Pop arranged two grass stems in his fist. â€˜The long one is for David Garrick and his pal,â€™ he explained. â€˜The short one is the two nudist sportsmen.â€™ â€˜Do you want to draw first?â€™ â€˜Go ahead,â€™ Karl said. I drew David Garrick and Abdullah. â€˜I got the bloody tragedian.â€™ â€˜He may be very good,â€™ Karl said. â€˜Do you want to trade?â€™ â€˜No. He may be a marvel.â€™ â€˜Now weâ€™ll draw for choice of beats. The long straw gets first choice,â€™ Pop explained. â€˜Go ahead and draw.â€™ Karl drew the short one. â€˜What are the beats?â€™ I asked Pop. There was a long conversation in which our David simulated the killing of half a dozen kudu from different types of ambush, surprise, stalks in the open, and jumping them in the bush. Finally Pop said, â€˜It seems thereâ€™s some sort of a salt-lick where they come to lick salt and thousands are slain. Then sometimes you just stroll around the hill there and pot the poor beggars in the open. If youâ€™re feeling frightfully fit, you climb for them and up in the crags you knock them over as they stroll out to feed.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ll take the salt-lick.â€™ â€˜Mind you only shoot the very biggest sort,â€™ Pop said. â€˜When do we start?â€™ Karl asked. â€˜The salt-lick is supposed to be an early morning-show,â€™ Pop told us. â€˜But Old Hem might as well have a look at it to-night. Itâ€™s about five miles down the road before you start to walk. Heâ€™ll start first and take the car. You can start back in the hills any time after the sun gets a little farther down.â€™ â€˜What about the Memsahib?â€™ I asked. â€˜Should she go with me?â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t think itâ€™s advisable,â€™ Pop said seriously. â€˜The fewer people when youâ€™re after kudu the better.â€™ Mâ€™Cola, Theatre Business, Abdullah, and I came back that evening late in the cool of the night and full of excitement as we came up to the fire. The dust of the salt-lick had been cut up and printed deep with fresh kudu tracks and there were several big bull tracks. The blind made a marvellous ambush and I was as confident and as sure of a shot at kudu the next morning as I would be sure of a shot at ducks from a good blind, with a fine stock of decoys out, cold weather, and the certainty of a flight on. â€˜Itâ€™s airtight. Itâ€™s foolproof. Itâ€™s even a shame. Whatâ€™s his name, Booth, Barrett, McCulloughâ€”you know who I mean . . .â€™ â€˜Charles Laughton,â€™ said Pop, pulling on his pipe. â€˜Thatâ€™s the one. Fred Astaire. Societyâ€™s hoofer and the worldâ€™s. Heâ€™s an ace. Found the blind and everything. Knew where the salt-lick was. Could tell which way the wind blew by simply scattering dust. Heâ€™s a marvel. Bâ€™wana Simba trains â€˜em, pal. Pop, we have them in the container. Itâ€™s only a question of not spoiling the meat and selecting the more rugged specimens. Iâ€™ll kill you two to-morrow on that lick. Citizens, I feel very well.â€™ â€˜What have you been drinking?â€™ â€˜Not a damned thing, really. Call Garrick. Tell him Iâ€™ll put him in the cinema. Got a part for him. Little thing I thought up on the way home. It may not work out but I like the plot. Othello or The Moor of Venice. Dâ€™you like it? Itâ€™s got a wonderful idea. You see this jig we call Othello falls in love with this girl whoâ€™s never been around at all so we call her Desdemona. Like it? Theyâ€™ve been after me to write it for years but I drew the colour line. Let him go out and get a reputation, I told them. Harry Wills, hell. Paulino beat him. Sharkey beat him. Dempsey beat Sharkey. Carnera knocked him out. What if nobody saw the punch? Where the hell were we, Pop? Harry Greb is dead you know.â€™ â€˜We were just coming into Town,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Chaps were throwing things at you and we couldnâ€™t find out why.â€™ â€˜I remember,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Why didnâ€™t you make him draw the colour line, Mr. J. P.?â€™ â€˜I was frightfully tired,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Youâ€™re very distinguished looking, though,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜What are we going to do with this goofy?â€™ â€˜Throw a drink into the brute and see if heâ€™ll quiet down.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m quiet now,â€™ I said. â€˜But, by God, I feel awfully good about to-morrow.â€™ Just then who should come into camp but old Karl with his two naked savages and his half-size, very devout Mohammedan gun bearer, Charo. In the firelight old Karl looked a greyish, yellowish white in the face and he took off his Stetson. â€˜Well, did you get one?â€™ he asked. â€˜No. But theyâ€™re there. What did you do?â€™ â€˜Walked along a goddamned road. How do they expect to find kudu along a road with nothing but cattle and huts and people?â€™ He did not look like himself and I thought he must be ill. But coming in like a deathâ€™s head when we had been clowning made me behave badly again and I said, â€˜We drew lots, you knowâ€™. â€˜Of course,â€™ he said bitterly. â€˜We hunted along a road. What would you expect to see? Does that seem the way to hunt kudu to you?â€™ â€˜But youâ€™ll get one on the salt-lick in the morning,â€™ P.O.M. told him very cheerfully. I drank off the glass of whisky and soda and heard my voice say very cheerfully, â€˜Youâ€™ll be sure to get one on the salt-lick in the morningâ€™. â€˜Youâ€™re hunting it in the morning,â€™ Karl said. â€˜No. Youâ€™re hunting it. I had it to-night. Weâ€™re changing off. Thatâ€™s been understood. Isnâ€™t it, Pop?â€™ â€˜Quite,â€™ Pop said. No one was looking at anyone else. â€˜Have a whisky and soda, Karl,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜All right,â€™ Karl said. We had one of those quiet meals. In bed in the tent, I said, â€˜What in Godâ€™s name prompted you to say that about him having the lick in the morning?â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s what I meant to say. I got mixed up. Letâ€™s not talk about it.â€™ â€˜I won the damned thing drawing lots. You canâ€™t go against lots. Thatâ€™s the only way the luck has a chance to even up, ever.â€™ â€˜Donâ€™t letâ€™s talk about it.â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t think heâ€™s well now and he doesnâ€™t feel himself. The damned things have gotten his goat and heâ€™s liable to blow that salt-lick higher than a kite in the state heâ€™s in.â€™ â€˜Please stop talking about it.â€™ â€˜I will.â€™ â€˜Good.â€™ â€˜Well, we made him feel good anyway.â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t know that we did. Please stop talking about it.â€™ â€˜I will.â€™ â€˜Good.â€™ â€˜Good night,â€™ she said. â€˜The hell with it,â€™ I said. â€˜Good night.â€™ â€˜Good night.â€™ CHAPTER SEVEN In the morning Karl and his outfit started for the salt-lick and Garrick, Abdullah, Mâ€™Cola and I crossed the road, angled behind the village up a dry watercourse and started climbing the mountains in a mist. We headed up a pebbly, boulder-filled, dry stream bed overgrown with vines and brush so that, climbing, you walked, stooping, in a steep tunnel of vines and foliage. I sweated so that I was soaked through my shirt and undergarments and when we came out on the shoulder of the mountain and stood, looking down at the bank of clouds quilting over the entire valley below us, the morning breeze chilled me and I had to put on my raincoat while we glassed the cows and a calf feed out from the timber, moving with the quickly browsing, then head lifted, long-staring vigilance of all browsing animals in a forest. Animals on a plain can see so far that they have confidence and feed very differently from animals in the woods. We could see the vertical white stripes on their grey flanks and it was very satisfying to watch them and to be high in the mountain that early in the morning. Then, while we watched, there was a boom, like a rockslide. I thought at first it was a boulder falling, but Mâ€™Cola whispered. â€˜Bâ€™wana Kibor! Piga!â€™ We listened for another shot but we did not hear one and I was sure Karl had his kudu. The cows we were watching had heard the shot and stood, listening, then went on feeding. But they fed into the timber. I remembered the old saying of the Indian in camp, â€˜One shot, meat. Two shots, maybe. Three shots, heap sâ€”t,â€™ and I got out the dictionary to translate it for Mâ€™Cola. However it came out seemed to amuse him and he laughed and shook his head. We glassed that valley until the sun came on to us, then hunted around the other side of the mountain and in another fine valley saw the place where the other Bâ€™wana, Bâ€™wana Doktor he still sounded like, had shot a fine bull kudu, but a Masai walked down the centre of the valley while we were glassing it and when I pretended I was going to shoot him Garrick became very dramatic insisting it was a man, a man, a man! â€˜Donâ€™t shoot men?â€™ I asked him. â€˜No! No! No!â€™ he said putting his hand to his head. I took the gun down with great reluctance, clowning for Mâ€™Cola who was grinning, and it very hot now, we walked across a meadow where the grass was knee high and truly swarming with long, rose-coloured, gauze-winged locusts that rose in clouds about us, making a whirring like a mowing machine, and climbing small hills and going down a long steep slope, we made our way back to camp to find the air of the valley drifting with flying locusts and Karl already in camp with his kudu. Passing the skinnerâ€™s tent he showed me the head which looked, body-less and neck-less, the cape of hide hanging loose, wet and heavy from where the base of the skull had been severed from the vertebral column, a very strange and unfortunate kudu. Only the skin running from the eyes down to the nostrils, smooth grey and delicately marked with white, and the big, graceful ears were beautiful. The eyes were already dusty and there were flies around them and the horns were heavy, coarse, and instead of spiralling high they made a heavy turn and slanted straight out. It was a freak head, heavy and ugly. Pop was sitting under the dining tent smoking and reading. â€˜Whereâ€™s Karl?â€™ I asked him. â€˜In his tent, I think. What did you do?â€™ â€˜Worked around the hill. Saw a couple of cows.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m awfully glad you got him,â€™ I told Karl at the mouth of his tent. â€˜How was it?â€™ â€˜We were in the blind and they motioned me to keep my head down and then when I looked up there he was right beside us. He looked huge.â€™ â€˜We heard you shoot. Where did you hit him?â€™ â€˜In the leg first, I think. Then we trailed him and finally I hit him a couple of more times and we got him.â€™ â€˜I heard only one shot.â€™ â€˜There were three or four,â€™ Karl said. â€˜I guess the mountain shut off some if you were gone the other way trailing him. Heâ€™s got a heavy beam and a big spread.â€™ â€˜Thanks,â€™ Karl said. â€˜I hope you get a lot better one. They said there was another one but I didnâ€™t see him.â€™ I went back to the dining tent where Pop and P.O.M. were. They did not seem very elated about the kudu. â€˜Whatâ€™s the matter with you?â€™ I asked. â€˜Did you see the head?â€™ P.O.M. asked. â€˜Sure.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s awful looking,â€™ she said. â€˜Itâ€™s a kudu. Heâ€™s got another one still to go.â€™ â€˜Charo and the trackers said there was another bull with this one. A big bull with a wonderful head.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s all right. Iâ€™ll shoot him.â€™ â€˜If he ever comes back.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s fine he has one,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Iâ€™ll bet heâ€™ll get the biggest one ever known, now,â€™ I said. â€˜Iâ€™m sending him down with Dan to the sable country,â€™ Pop said. â€˜That was the agreement. The first to kill a kudu to get first crack at the sable.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s fine.â€™ â€˜Then as soon as you get your kudu weâ€™ll move down there too.â€™ â€˜Good.â€˜ PART III PURSUIT AND FAILURE CHAPTER ONE That all seemed a year ago. Now, this afternoon in the car, on the way out to the twenty-eight-mile salt-lick, the sun on our faces, just having shot the guinea fowl, having, in the last five days, failed on the lick where Karl shot his bull, having failed in the hills, the big hills and the small hills, having failed on the flats, losing a shot the night before on this lick because of the Austrianâ€™s lorry, I knew there were only two days more to hunt before we must leave. Mâ€™Cola knew it too, and we were hunting together now, with no feeling of superiority on either side any more, only a shortness of time and our disgust that we did not know the country and were saddled with these farcical bastards as guides. be short a driver; while now whenever or wherever he should die I would feel badly. Then abandoning the sweet sentiment of the distant and improbable death of Kamau, I thought what a pleasure it would be to shoot David Garrick in the behind, just to see the look on his face, sometime when he was dramatizing a stalk, and, just then, we put up another flock of guineas. Mâ€™Cola handed me the shotgun and I shook my head. He nodded violently and said, â€˜Good. Very Goodâ€™, and I told Kamau to go on. This confused Garrick who began an oration. Didnâ€™t we want guineas? Those were guineas. The finest kind. I had seen by the speedometer that we were only about three miles from the salt and had no desire to spook a bull off of it, by a shot, to frighten him in the way we had seen the lesser kudu leave the salt when he heard the lorry noise while we were in the blind. We left the lorry under some scrubby trees about two miles from the lick and walked along the sandy road towards the first salt place which was in the open to the left of the trail. We had gone about a mile keeping absolutely quiet and walking in single file, Abdullah the educated tracker leading, then me, Mâ€™Cola, and Garrick, when we saw the road was wet ahead of us. Where the sand was thin over the clay there was a pool of water and you could see that a heavy rain had drenched it all on ahead. I did not realize what this meant but Garrick threw his arms wide, looked up to the sky and bared his teeth in anger. â€˜Itâ€™s no good,â€™ Mâ€™Cola whispered. Garrick started to talk in a loud voice. â€˜Shut up, you bastard,â€™ I said, and put my hand to my mouth. He kept on talking in above normal tones and I looked up â€˜shut upâ€™ in the dictionary while he pointed to the sky and the rained-out road. I couldnâ€™t find â€˜shut upâ€™ so I put the back of my hand against his mouth with some firmness and he closed it in surprise. â€˜â€™Cola,â€™ I said. â€˜Yes,â€™ said Mâ€™Cola. â€˜Whatâ€™s the matter?â€™ â€˜Salt no good.â€™ â€˜Ah.â€™ So that was it. I had thought of the rain only as something that made tracking easy. â€˜When the rain?â€™ I asked. â€˜Last night,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said. Garrick started to talk and I placed the back of my hand against his mouth. â€˜â€™Cola.â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜Other salt,â€™ pointing in the direction of the big lick in the woods, which I knew was a good bit higher because we went very slightly up hill through the brush to reach it. â€˜Other salt good?â€™ â€˜Maybe.â€™ Mâ€™Cola said something in a very low voice to Garrick who seemed deeply hurt but kept his mouth shut and we went on down the road, walking around the wet places, to where, sure enough, the deep depression of the salt-lick was half filled with water. Garrick started to whisper a speech here but Mâ€™Cola shut him up again. â€˜Come on,â€™ I said, and, Mâ€™Cola ahead, we started trailing up the damp, sandy, ordinarily dry watercourse that led through the trees to the upper lick. Mâ€™Cola stopped dead, leaned over to look at the damp sand, then whispered, â€˜Manâ€™, to me. There was the track. â€˜Shenzi,â€™ he said, which meant a wild man. We trailed the man, moving slowly through the trees and stalking the lick carefully, up and into the blind. Mâ€™Cola shook his head. â€˜No good,â€™ he said. â€˜Come on.â€™ We went over to the lick. There it was all written plainly. There were the tracks of three big bull kudu in the moist bank beyond the lick where they had come to the salt. Then there were the sudden, deep, knifely-cut tracks where they made a spring when the bow twanged and the slashing heavily cut prints of their hoofs as they had gone off up the bank and then, far-spaced, the tracks running into the bush. We trailed them, all three, but no manâ€™s track joined theirs. The bow-man missed them. Mâ€™Cola said, â€˜Shenzi!â€™ putting great hate into the word. We picked up the shenziâ€™s tracks and saw where he had gone on back to the road. We settled down in the blind and waited there until it was dark and a light rain began to fall. Nothing came to the salt. In the rain we made our way back to the lorry. Some wild-man had shot at our kudu and spooked them away from the salt and now the lick was being ruined. Kamau had rigged a tent out of a big canvas ground cloth, hung my mosquito net inside, and set up the canvas cot. Mâ€™Cola brought the food inside the shelter tent. Garrick and Abdullah built a fire and they, Kamau and Mâ€™Cola cooked over it. They were going to sleep in the lorry. It rained drizzlingly and I undressed, got into mosquito boots and heavy pyjamas and sat on the cot, ate a breast of roast guinea hen and drank a couple of tin cups of half whisky and water. Mâ€™Cola came in, grave, solicitous, and very awkward inside a tent and took my clothes out from where I had folded them to make a pillow and folded them again, very un-neatly, and put them under the blankets. He brought three tins to see if I did not want them opened. â€˜No.â€™ â€˜Chai?â€™ he asked. â€˜The hell with it.â€™ â€˜No chai?â€™ â€˜Whisky better.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ he said feelingly. â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜Chai in the morning. Before the sun.â€™ â€˜Yes, Bâ€™wana Mâ€™Kumba.â€™ â€˜You sleep here. Out of the rain.â€™ I pointed to the canvas where the rain was making the finest sound that we, who live much outside of houses, ever hear. It was a lovely sound, even though it was bitching us. â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜Go on. Eat.â€™ â€˜Yes. No chai?â€™ â€˜The hell with tea.â€™ â€˜Whisky?â€™ he asked hopefully. â€˜Whisky finish.â€™ â€˜Whisky,â€™ he said confidently. â€˜All right,â€™ I said. â€˜Go eat,â€™ and pouring the cup half and half with water got in under the mosquito bar, found my clothes and again made them into a pillow, and lying on my side drank the whisky very slowly, resting on one elbow, then dropped the cup down under the bar on to the ground, felt under the cot for the Springfield, put the searchlight beside me in the bed under the blanket, and went to sleep listening to the rain. I woke when I heard Mâ€™Cola come in, make his bed and go to sleep, and I woke once in the night and heard him sleeping by me; but in the morning he was up and had made the tea before I was awake. â€˜Chai,â€™ he said, pulling on my blanket. â€˜Bloody chai,â€™ I said, sitting up still asleep. It was a grey, wet morning. The rain had stopped but the mist hung over the ground and we found the salt-lick rained out and not a track near it. Then we hunted through the wet scrub on the flat hoping to find a track in the soaked earth and trail a bull until we could see him. There were no tracks. We crossed the road and followed the edge of the scrub around a moor-like open stretch. I hoped we might find the rhino but while we came on much fresh rhino dung there were no tracks since the rain. Once we heard tick birds and looking up saw them in jerky flight above us headed to the northward over the heavy scrub. We made a long circle through there but found nothing but a fresh hyena track and a cow kudu track. In a tree Mâ€™Cola pointed out a lesser kudu skull with one beautiful, long, curling horn. We found the other horn below in the grass and I screwed it back on to its bone base. â€˜Shenzi,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said and imitated a man pulling a bow. The skull was quite clean but the hollow horns had some damp residue in them, smelled unbearably foul and, giving no sign of having noticed the stench, I handed them to Garrick who promptly, without sign gave them to Abdullah. Abdullah wrinkled the edge of his flat nose and shook his head. They really smelled abominably. Mâ€™Cola and I grinned and Garrick looked virtuous. I decided a good idea might be to drive along the road in the car, watching for kudu, and hunt any likely-looking clearings. We went back to the car and did this, working several clearings with no luck. By then the sun was up and the road was becoming populous with travellers, both white-clothed and naked, and we decided to head for camp. On our way in, we stopped and stalked the other salt-lick. There was an impalla on it looking very red where the sun struck his hide in the patches between the grey trees and there were many kudu tracks. We smoothed them over and drove on into camp to find a sky full of locusts passing over, going to the westward, making the sky, as you looked up, seem a pink dither of flickering passage, flickering like an old cinema film, but pink instead of grey. P.O.M. and Pop came out and were very disappointed. No rain had fallen in camp and they had been sure we would have something when we came in. â€˜Did my literary pal get off?â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Heâ€™s gone into Handeni.â€™ â€˜He told me all about American women,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Poor old Poppa, I was sure youâ€™d get one. Damn the rain.â€™ â€˜How are American women?â€™ â€˜He thinks theyâ€™re terrible.â€™ â€˜Very sound fellow,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Tell me just what happened to-day.â€™ We sat in the shade of the dining tent and I told them. â€˜A Wanderobo,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Theyâ€™re frightful shots. Bad luck.â€™ â€˜I thought it might be one of those travelling sportsmen you see with their bows slung going along the road. He saw the lick by the road and trailed up to the other one.â€™ â€˜Not very likely. They carry those bows and arrows as protection. Theyâ€™re not hunters.â€™ â€˜Well, whoever it was put it on us.â€™ â€˜Bad luck. That, and the rain. Iâ€™ve had scouts out here on both the hills but theyâ€™ve seen nothing.â€™ â€˜Well, weâ€™re not bitched until to-morrow night. When do we have to leave?â€™ â€˜After to-morrow.â€™ â€˜That bloody savage.â€™ â€˜I suppose Karl is blasting up the sable down there.â€™ â€˜We wonâ€™t be able to get into camp for the horns. Have you heard anything?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m going to give up smoking for six months for you to get one,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Iâ€™ve started already.â€™ We had lunch and afterwards I went into the tent and lay down and read. I knew we still had a chance on the lick in the morning and I was not going to worry about it. But I was worried and I did not want to go to sleep and wake up feeling dopey so I came out and sat in one of the canvas chairs under the open dining tent and read somebodyâ€™s life of Charles the Second and looked up every once in a while to watch the locusts. The locusts were exciting to see and it was difficult for me to take them as a matter of course. Finally I went to sleep in the chair with my feet on a chop-box and when I woke there was Garrick, the bastard, wearing a large, very floppy, black and white ostrich-plume head-dress. â€˜Go away,â€™ I said in English. He stood smirking proudly, then turned so I could see the head-dress from the side. I saw Pop coming out of his tent with a pipe in his mouth. â€˜Look what we have,â€™ I called to him. He looked, said, â€˜Christâ€™, and went back into the tent. â€˜Come on,â€™ I said. â€˜Weâ€™ll just ignore it.â€™ Pop came out, finally, with a book and we took no notice of Garrickâ€™s head-dress at all, sitting and talking, while he posed with it. â€˜Bastardâ€™s been drinking, too,â€™ I said. â€˜Probably.â€™ â€˜I can smell it.â€™ Pop, without looking at him, spoke a few words to Garrick in a very soft voice. â€˜What did you tell him?â€™ â€˜To go and get dressed properly and be ready to start.â€™ Garrick walked off, his plumes waving. â€˜Not the moment for his ostrich plumes,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Some people probably like them.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s it. Start photographing them.â€™ â€˜Awful,â€™ I said. â€˜Frightful,â€™ Pop agreed. â€˜On the last day if we donâ€™t get anything, Iâ€™m going to shoot Garrick in the behind. What would that cost me?â€™ â€˜Might make lots of trouble. If you shoot one, you have to shoot the other, too.â€™ â€˜Only Garrick.â€™ â€˜Better not shoot then. Remember itâ€™s me you get into trouble.â€™ â€˜Joking, Pop.â€™ Garrick, un-head-dressed and with Abdullah, appeared and Pop spoke with them. â€˜They want to hunt around the hill a new way.â€™ â€˜Splendid. When?â€™ â€˜Any time now. It looks like rain. You might get going.â€™ I sent Molo for my boots and a raincoat, Mâ€™Cola came out with the Springfield; and we walked down to the car. It had been heavily cloudy all day although the sun had come through the clouds in the forenoon for a time and again at noon. The rains were moving up on us. Now it was starting to rain and the locusts were no longer flying. â€˜Iâ€™m dopey with sleep,â€™ I told Pop. â€˜Iâ€™m going to have a drink.â€™ We were standing under the big tree by the cooking fire with the light rain pattering in the leaves. Mâ€™Cola brought the whisky flask and handed it to me very solemnly. â€˜Have one?â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t see what harm it can do.â€™ We both drank and Pop said, â€˜The hell with them.â€™ â€˜The hell with them.â€™ â€˜You may find some tracks.â€™ â€˜Weâ€™ll run them out of the country.â€™ In the car we turned to the right on the road, drove on up past the mud village and turned off the road to the left on to a red, hard, clay track that circled the edge of the hills and was close bordered on either side with trees. It was raining fairly hard now and we drove slowly. There seemed to be enough sand in the clay to keep the car from slipping. Suddenly, from the back seat, Abdullah, very excited, told Kamau to stop. We stopped with a skid, all got out, and walked back. There was a freshly cut kudu track in the wet clay. It could not have been made more than five minutes before as it was sharp-edged and the dirt, that had been picked up by the inside of the hoof, was not yet softened by the rain. â€˜Doumi,â€™ Garrick said and threw back his head and spread his arms wide to show horns that hung back over his withers. â€˜Kubwa Sana!â€™ Abdullah agreed it was a bull; a huge bull. â€˜Come on,â€™ I said. It was easy tracking and we knew we were close. In rain or snow it is much easier to come up close to animals and I was sure we were going to get a shot. We followed the tracks through thick brush and then out into an open patch. I stopped to wipe the rain off my glasses and blew through the aperture in the rear sight of the Springfield. It was raining hard now, and I pulled my hat low down over my eyes to keep my glasses dry. We skirted the edge of the open patch and then, ahead, there was a crash and I saw a grey, white-striped animal making off through the brush. I threw the gun up and Mâ€™Cola grabbed my arm, â€˜Manamouki!â€™ he whispered. It was a cow kudu. But when we came up to where it had jumped there were no other tracks. The same tracks we had followed led, logically and with no possibility of doubt, from the road to that cow. â€˜Doumi Kubwa Sana!â€™ I said, full of sarcasm and disgust to Garrick and made a gesture of giant horns flowing back from behind his ears. â€˜Manamouki Kubwa Sana,â€™ he said very sorrowfully and patiently. â€˜What an enormous cow.â€™ â€˜You lousy ostrich-plumed punk,â€™ I told him in English. â€˜Manamouki! Manamouki! Manamouki!â€™ â€˜Manamouki,â€™ said Mâ€™Cola and nodded his head. I got out the dictionary, couldnâ€™t find the words, and made it clear to Mâ€™Cola with signs that we would circle back in a long swing to the road and see if we could find another track. We circled back in the rain, getting thoroughly soaked, saw nothing, found the car, and as the rain lessened and the roads still seemed firm decided to go on until it was dark. Puffs of cloud hung on the hillside after the rain and the trees dripped but we saw nothing. Not in the open glades, not in the fields where the bush thinned, not on the green hillsides. Finally it was dark and we went back to camp. The Springfield was very wet when we got out of the car and I told Mâ€™Cola to clean it carefully and oil it well. He said he would and I went on and into the tent where a lantern was burning, took off my clothes, had a bath in the canvas tub and came out to the fire comfortable and relaxed in pyjamas, dressing-gown and mosquito boots. P.O.M. and Pop were sitting in their chairs by the fire and P.O.M. got up to make me a whisky and soda. â€˜Mâ€™Cola told me,â€™ Pop said from his chair by the fire. â€˜A damned big cow,â€™ I told him. â€˜I nearly busted her. What do you think about the morning?â€™ â€˜The lick I suppose. Weâ€™ve scouts out to watch both of these hills. You remember that old man from the village? Heâ€™s on a wild-goose chase after them in some country over beyond the hills. He and the Wanderobo. Theyâ€™ve been gone three days.â€™ â€˜Thereâ€™s no reason why we shouldnâ€™t get one on the lick where Karl shot his. One day is as good as another.â€™ â€˜Quite.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s the last damned day though and the lick may be rained out. As soon as itâ€™s wet thereâ€™s no salt. Just mud.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s it.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™d like to see one.â€™ â€˜When you do, take your time and make sure of him. Take your time and kill him.â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t worry about that.â€™ â€˜Letâ€™s talk about something else,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜This makes me too nervous.â€™ â€˜I wish we had old Leather Pants,â€™ Pop said. â€˜God, he was a talker. He made the old man here talk too. Give us that spiel on modern writers again.â€™ â€˜Go to hell.â€™ â€˜Why donâ€™t we have some intellectual life?â€™ P.O.M. asked. â€˜Why donâ€™t you men ever discuss world topics? Why am I kept in ignorance of everything that goes on?â€™ â€˜Worldâ€™s in a hell of a shape,â€™ Pop stated. â€˜Awful.â€™ â€˜Whatâ€™s going on in America?â€™ â€˜Damned if I know! Some sort of Y.M.C.A. show. Starry eyed bastards spending money that somebody will have to pay. Everybody in our town quit work to go on relief. Fishermen all turned carpenters. Reverse of the Bible.â€™ â€˜How are things in Turkey?â€™ â€˜Frightful. Took the fezzes away. Hanged any amount of old pals. Ismetâ€™s still around though.â€™ â€˜Been in France lately?â€™ â€˜Didnâ€™t like it. Gloomy as hell. Been a bad show there just now.â€™ â€˜By God,â€™ said Pop, â€˜it must have been if you can believe the papers.â€™ â€˜When they riot they really riot. Hell, theyâ€™ve got a tradition.â€™ â€˜Were you in Spain for the revolution?â€™ â€˜I got there late. Then we waited for two that didnâ€™t come. Then we missed another.â€™ â€˜Did you see the one in Cuba?â€™ â€˜From the start.â€™ â€˜How was it?â€™ â€˜Beautiful. Then lousy. You couldnâ€™t believe how lousy.â€™ â€˜Stop it,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜I know about those things. I was crouched down behind a marble-topped table while they were shooting in Havana. They came by in cars shooting at everybody they saw. I took my drink with me and I was very proud not to have spilled it or forgotten it. The children said, "Mother, can we go out in the afternoon to see the shooting?" They got so worked up about revolution we had to stop mentioning it. Bumby got so bloodthirsty about Mr. M. he had terrible dreams.â€™ â€˜Extraordinary,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Donâ€™t make fun of me. I donâ€™t want to just hear about revolutions. All we see or hear is revolutions. Iâ€™m sick of them.â€™ â€˜The old man must like them.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m sick of them.â€™ â€˜You know, Iâ€™ve never seen one,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Theyâ€™re beautiful. Really. For quite a while. Then they go bad.â€™ â€˜Theyâ€™re very exciting,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Iâ€™ll admit that. But Iâ€™m sick of them. Really, I donâ€™t care anything about them.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ve been studying them a little.â€™ â€˜What did you find out?â€™ Pop asked. â€˜They were all very different but there were some things you could co-ordinate. Iâ€™m going to try to write a study of them.â€™ â€˜It could be damned interesting.â€™ â€˜If you have enough material. You need an awful lot of past performances. Itâ€™s very hard to get anything true on anything you havenâ€™t seen yourself because the ones that fail have such a bad press and the winners always lie so. Then you can only really follow anything in places where you speak the language. That limits you of course. Thatâ€™s why I would never go to Russia. When you canâ€™t overhear itâ€™s no good. All you get are handouts and sight-seeing. Any one who knows a foreign language in any country is damned liable to lie to you. You get your good dope always from the people and when you canâ€™t talk with people and canâ€™t overhear you donâ€™t get anything thatâ€™s of anything but journalistic value.â€™ â€˜You want to knuckle down on your Swahili then.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m trying to.â€™ â€˜Even then you canâ€™t overhear because theyâ€™re always talking their own language.â€™ â€˜But if I ever write anything about this it will just be landscape painting until I know something about it. Your first seeing of a country is a very valuable one. Probably more valuable to yourself than to anyone else, is the hell of it. But you ought to always write it to try to get it stated. No matter what you do with it.â€™ â€˜Most of the damned Safari books are most awful bloody bores.â€™ â€˜Theyâ€™re terrible.â€™ â€˜The only one I ever liked was Streeterâ€™s. What did he call it? Denatured Africa. He made you feel what it was like. Thatâ€™s the best.â€™ â€˜I liked Charlie Curtisâ€™s. It was very honest and it made a fine picture.â€™ â€˜That man Streeter was damned funny though. Do you remember when he shot the kongoni?â€™ â€˜It was very funny.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ve never read anything, though, that could make you feel about the country the way we feel about it. They all have Nairobi fast life or else rot about shooting beasts with horns half an inch longer than someone else shot. Or muck about danger.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™d like to try to write something about the country and the animals and what itâ€™s like to someone who knows nothing about it.â€™ â€˜Have a try at it. Canâ€™t do any harm. You know I wrote a diary of that Alaskan trip.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™d love to read it,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜I didnâ€™t know you were a writer, Mr. J. P.â€™ â€˜No bloody fear,â€™ said Pop. â€˜If youâ€™d read it, though, Iâ€™ll send for it. You know itâ€™s just what we did each day and how Alaska looked to an Englishman from Africa. Itâ€™d bore you.â€™ â€˜Not if you wrote it,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Little womanâ€™s giving us compliments,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Not me. You.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ve read things by him,â€™ she said. â€˜I want to read what Mr. J. P. writes.â€™ â€˜Is the old man really a writer?â€™ Pop asked her. â€˜I havenâ€™t seen anything to prove it. Youâ€™re sure he doesnâ€™t support you by tracking and wing shooting?â€™ â€˜Oh, yes. He writes. When heâ€™s going well heâ€™s awfully easy to get along with. But just before he gets going heâ€™s frightful. His temper has to go bad before he can write. When he talks about never writing again I know heâ€™s about to get started.â€™ â€˜We ought to get more literary conversation from him,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Leather Breeches was the lad. Give us some literary anecdotes.â€™ â€˜Well, the last night we were in Paris Iâ€™d been out shooting at Ben Gallagherâ€™s in the Sologne the day before and he had a fermÃ©e, you know, they put up a low fence while theyâ€™re out feeding, and shot rabbits in the morning and in the afternoon we had several drives and shot pheasants and I shot a chevreuil.â€™ â€˜That isnâ€™t literary.â€™ â€˜Wait. The last night Joyce and his wife came to dinner and we had a pheasant and a quarter of the chevreuil with the saddle and Joyce and I got drunk because we were off for Africa the next day. God, we had a night.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s a hell of a literary anecdote,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Whoâ€™s Joyce?â€™ â€˜Wonderful guy,â€™ I said. â€˜Wrote Ulysses.â€™ â€˜Homer wrote Ulysses,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Who wrote Ã†schylus?â€™ â€˜Homer,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Donâ€™t try to trap me. Dâ€™you know many more literary anecdotes?â€™ â€˜Ever heard of Pound?â€™ â€˜No,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Absolutely no.â€™ â€˜I know some good ones about Pound.â€™ â€˜Suppose you and he ate some funny-sounding beast and then got drunk.â€™ â€˜Several times,â€™ I said. â€˜Literary life must be awfully jolly. Think Iâ€™d make a writer?â€™ â€˜Rather.â€™ â€˜Weâ€™re going to chuck all this,â€™ Pop told P.O.M., â€˜and both be writers. Give us another anecdote.â€™ â€˜Ever heard of George Moore?â€™ â€˜Chap that wrote "But before I go, George Moore, hereâ€™s a last long health to you?"â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s him.â€™ â€˜What about him?â€™ â€˜Heâ€™s dead.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s a damned dismal anecdote. You can do better than that.â€™ â€˜I saw him in a book-shop once.â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s better. See how lively he can make them?â€™ â€˜I went to call on him once in Dublin,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜With Clara Dunn.â€™ â€˜What happened?â€™ â€˜He wasnâ€™t in.â€™ â€˜By God. I tell you the literary lifeâ€™s the thing,â€™ Pop said. â€˜You canâ€™t beat it.â€™ â€˜I hate Clara Dunn,â€™ I said. â€˜So do I,â€™ said Pop. â€˜What did she write?â€™ â€˜Letters,â€™ I said. â€˜You know Dos Passos?â€™ â€˜Never heard of him.â€™ â€˜He and I used to drink hot kirsch in the winter time.â€™ â€˜What happened then?â€™ â€˜People objected, finally.â€™ â€˜Only writer I ever met was Stewart Edward White,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Used to admire his writing no end. Damned good, you know. Then I met him. Didnâ€™t like him.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™re coming on,â€™ I said. â€˜See. Thereâ€™s no trick to a literary anecdote.â€™ â€˜Why didnâ€™t you like him?â€™ P.O.M. asked. â€˜Do I have to tell? Isnâ€™t the anecdote complete? Itâ€™s just like the old man tells them.â€™ â€˜Go ahead and tell.â€™ â€˜Too much the old timer about him. Eyes used to vast distances and that sort of thing. Killed too many bloody lions. No credit kill so many lions. Gallop â€˜em, yes. Couldnâ€™t kill that many. Lion kill you instead. Writes damned fine things in The Saturday Evening Post about, whatâ€™s the blokeâ€™s name, Andy Burnett. Oh, damned fine. Took an awful dislike to him, though. See him in Nairobi with his eyes used to vast distances. Wore his oldest clothes in town. Hell of a fine shot, everybody says.â€™ â€˜Why youâ€™re a literary bastard,â€™ I said. â€˜Look at that for an anecdote.â€™ â€˜Heâ€™s marvellous,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Arenâ€™t we ever going to eat?â€™ â€˜Thought by God weâ€™d eaten,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Start these anecdotes. No end to â€˜em.â€™ After dinner we sat by the fire a little while and then went to bed. One thing seemed to be on Popâ€™s mind and before I went in the tent he said, â€˜After youâ€™ve waited so long, when you get a shot take it easy. Youâ€™re fast enough so you can take your time, remember. Take it easy.â€™ â€˜All right.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ll have them get you up early.â€™ â€˜All right. Iâ€™m plenty sleepy.â€™ â€˜Good night, Mr. J. P.,â€™ P.O.M. called from the tent. â€˜Good night,â€™ Pop said. He moved toward his tent carrying himself with comic stiffness, walking in the dark as carefully as though he were an opened bottle. CHAPTER TWO Molo waked me by pulling on the blanket in the morning and I was dressing, dressed, and out washing the sleep out of my eyes before I was really awake. It was still very dark and I could see Popâ€™s back shadowed against the fire. I walked over holding the early morning cup of hot tea and milk in my hand waiting for it to be cool enough to drink. â€˜Morning,â€™ I said. â€˜Morning,â€™ he answered in that husky whisper. â€˜Sleep?â€™ â€˜Very well. Feeling fit?â€™ â€˜Sleepy is all.â€™ I drank the tea and spat the leaves into the fire. â€˜Tell your bloody fortune with those,â€™ Pop said. â€˜No fear.â€™ Breakfast in the dark with a lantern, cool juice-slippery apricots, hash, hot-centred, brown, and catsup spread, two fried eggs and the warm promise-keeping coffee. On the third cup Pop, watching, smoking his pipe, said, â€˜Too early for me to face it yet.â€™ â€˜Get you?â€™ â€˜A little.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m getting exercise,â€™ I said. â€˜It doesnâ€™t bother me.â€™ â€˜Bloody anecdotes,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Memsahib must think weâ€™re silly beggars.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ll think up some more.â€™ â€˜Nothing better than drinking. Donâ€™t know why it should make you feel bad.â€™ â€˜Are you bad?â€™ â€˜Not too.â€™ â€˜Take a spot of Enoâ€™s?â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s this damned riding in cars.â€™ â€˜Well, to-dayâ€™s the day.â€™ â€˜Remember to take it very easy.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™re not worried about that, are you?â€™ â€˜Just a touch.â€™ â€˜Donâ€™t. It never worries me a minute. Truly.â€™ â€˜Good. Better get going.â€™ â€˜Have to make a trip first.â€™ Standing in front of the canvas circle of the latrine I looked, as each morning, at that fuzzy blur of stars that the romanticists of astronomers called the Southern Cross. Each morning at this moment I observed the Southern Cross in solemn ceremony. Pop was at the car. Mâ€™Cola handed me the Springfield and I got in the front. The tragedian and his tracker were in the back. Mâ€™Cola climbed in with them. â€˜Good luck,â€™ Pop said. Someone was coming from towards the tents. It was P.O.M. in her blue robe and mosquito boots. â€™Oh, good luck,â€™ she said. â€™Please, good luck.â€™ I waved and we started, the headlights showing the way to the road. There was nothing on the salt when we came up to it after leaving the car about three miles away and making a very careful stalk. Nothing came all morning. We sat with our heads down in the blind, each covering a different direction through openings in the thatched withes, and always I expected the miracle of a bull kudu coming majestic and beautiful through the open scrub to the grey, dusty opening in the trees where the salt lick was worn, grooved, and trampled. There were many trails to it through the trees and on any one a bull might come silently. But nothing came. When the sun was up and we were warmed after the misty cold of the morning I settled my rump deeper in the dust and lay back against the wall of the hole, resting against the small of my back and my shoulders, and still able to see out through the slit in the blind. Putting the Springfield across my knees I noticed that there was rust on the barrel. Slowly I pulled it along and looked at the muzzle. It was freshly brown with rust. â€˜The bastard never cleaned it last night after that rain,â€™ I thought, and, very angry, I lifted the lug and slipped the bolt out. Mâ€™Cola was watching me with his head down. The other two were looking out through the blind. I held the rifle in one hand for him to look through the breech and then put the bolt back in and shoved it forward softly, lowering it with my finger on the trigger so that it was ready to cock rather than keeping it on the safety. Mâ€™Cola had seen the rusty bore. His face had not changed and I had said nothing but I was full of contempt and there had been indictment, evidence, and condemnation without a word being spoken. So we sat there, he with his head bent so only the bald top showed, me leaning back and looking out through the slit, and we were no longer partners, no longer good friends, and nothing came to the salt. At ten oâ€™clock the breeze, which had come up in the east, began to shift around and we knew it was no use. Our scent was being scattered in all directions around the blind as sure to frighten any animals as though we were revolving a searchlight in the dark. We got up out of the blind and went over to look in the dust of the lick for tracks. The rain had moistened it but it was not soaked and we saw several kudu tracks, probably made early in the night and one big bull track, long, narrow, heart-shaped; clearly, deeply cut. We took the track and followed it on the damp reddish earth for two hours in thick bush that was like second-growth timber at home. Finally we had to leave it in stuff we could not move through. All this time I was angry about the uncleaned rifle and yet happy and eager with anticipation that we might jump the bull and get a snap at him in the brush. But we did not see him and now, in the big heat of noon, we made three long circles around some hills and finally came out into a meadow full of little, humpy Masai cattle and, leaving all shade behind, trailed back across the open country under the noon sun to the car. Kamau, sitting in the car, had seen a kudu bull pass a hundred yards away. He was headed toward the salt-lick at about nine oâ€™clock when the wind began to be tricky, had evidently caught our scent and gone back into the hills. Tired, sweating, and feeling more sunk than angry now, I got in beside Kamau and we headed the car toward camp. There was only one evening left now, and no reason to expect we would have any better luck than we were having. As we came to camp, and the shade of the heavy trees, cool as a pool, I took the bolt out of the Springfield and handed the rifle, boltless, to Mâ€™Cola without speaking or looking at him. The bolt I tossed inside the opening of our tent on to my cot. Pop and P.O.M. were sitting under the dining tent. â€˜No luck?â€™ Pop asked gently. â€˜Not a damn bit. Bull went by the car headed toward the salt. Must have spooked off. We hunted all over hell.â€™ â€˜Didnâ€™t you see anything?â€™ P.O.M. asked. â€˜Once we thought we heard you shoot.â€™ â€˜That was Garrick shooting his mouth off. Did the scouts get anything?â€™ â€˜Not a thing. Weâ€™ve been watching both hills.â€™ â€˜Hear from Karl?â€™ â€˜Not a word.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™d like to have seen one,â€™ I said. I was tired out and slipping into bitterness fast. â€˜God damn them. What the hell did he have to blow that lick to hell for the first morning and gut-shoot a lousy bull and chase him all over the son-of-a-bitching country spooking it to holy bloody hell?â€™ â€˜Bastards,â€™ said P.O.M., staying with me in my unreasonableness. â€˜Sonsabitches.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™re a good girl,â€™ I said. â€˜Iâ€™m all right. Or I will be.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s been awful,â€™ she said. â€˜Poor old Poppa.â€™ â€˜You have a drink,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Thatâ€™s what you need.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ve hunted them hard, Pop. I swear to God I have. Iâ€™ve enjoyed it and I havenâ€™t worried up until to-day. I was so damned sure. Those damned tracks all the timeâ€”what if I never see one? How do I know we can ever get back here again?â€™ â€˜Youâ€™ll be back,â€™ Pop said. â€˜You donâ€™t have to worry about that. Go ahead. Drink it.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m just a lousy belly-aching bastard but I swear they havenâ€™t gotten on my nerves until to-day.â€™ â€˜Belly-ache,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Better to get it out.â€™ â€˜What about lunch?â€™ asked P.O.M. â€˜Arenâ€™t you frightfully hungry?â€™ â€˜The hell with lunch. The thing is, Pop, weâ€™ve never seen them on the salt in the evening and weâ€™ve never seen a bull in the hills. Iâ€™ve only got to-night. It looks washed up. Three times Iâ€™ve had them cold and Karl and the Austrian and the Wanderobo beat us.â€™ â€˜Weâ€™re not beaten,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Drink another one of those.â€™ We had lunch, a very good lunch, and it was just over when Kati came and said there was someone to see Pop. We could see their shadows on the tent fly, then they came around to the front of the tent. It was the old man of the first day, the old farmer, but now he was gotten up as a hunter and carried a long bow and a sealed quiver of arrows. He looked older, more disreputable and tireder than ever and his get-up was obviously a disguise. With him was the skinny, dirty, Wanderobo with the slit and curled up ears who stood on one leg and scratched the back of his knee with his toes. His head was on one side and he had a narrow, foolish, and depraved-looking face. The old man was talking earnestly to Pop, looking him in the eye and speaking slowly, without gestures. â€˜Whatâ€™s he done? Gotten himself up like that to get some of the scout money?â€™ I asked. â€˜Wait,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Look at the pair of them,â€™ I said. â€˜Thatâ€™s goofy Wanderobo and that lousy old fake. Whatâ€™s he say, Pop?â€™ â€˜He hasnâ€™t finished,â€™ Pop said. Finally the old man was finished and he stood there leaning on his property bow. They both looked very tired but I remember thinking they looked a couple of disgusting fakes. â€˜He says,â€™ Pop began, â€˜they have found a country where there are kudu and sable. He has been there three days. They know where there is a big kudu bull and he has a man watching him now.â€™ â€˜Do you believe it?â€™ I could feel the liquor and the fatigue drain out of me and the excitement come in. â€˜God knows,â€™ said Pop. â€˜How far away is the country?â€™ â€˜One dayâ€™s march. I suppose thatâ€™s three or four hours in the car if the car can go.â€™ â€˜Does he think the car can get in?â€™ â€˜None ever has been in but he thinks you can make it.â€™ â€˜When did they leave the man watching the kudu?â€™ â€˜This morning.â€™ â€˜Where are the sable?â€™ â€˜There in the hills.â€™ â€˜How do we get in?â€™ â€˜I canâ€™t make out except that you cross the plain, go around that mountain and then south. He says no one has ever hunted there. He hunted there when he was young.â€™ â€˜Do you believe it?â€™ â€˜Of course natives lie like hell, but he tells it very straight.â€™ â€˜Letâ€™s go.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™d better start right away. Go as far as you can in the car and then use it for a base and hunt on from there. The Memsahib and I will break camp in the morning, move the outfit and go on to where Dan and Mr. T. are. Once the outfit is over that black cotton stretch weâ€™re all right if the rain catches us. You come on and join us. If youâ€™re caught we can always send the car back by Kandoa, if worst comes, and the lorries down to Tanga and around.â€™ â€˜Donâ€™t you want to come?â€™ â€˜No. Youâ€™re better off alone on a show like this. The more people the less game youâ€™ll see. You should hunt kudu alone. Iâ€™ll move the outfit and look after the little Memsahib.â€™ â€˜All right,â€™ I said. â€˜And I donâ€™t have to take Garrick or Abdullah?â€™ â€˜Hell, no. Take Mâ€™Cola, Kamau and these two. Iâ€™ll tell Molo to pack your things. Go light as hell.â€™ â€˜God damn it, Pop. Do you think it could be true?â€™ â€˜Maybe,â€™ said Pop. â€˜We have to play it.â€™ â€˜How do you say sable?â€™ â€˜Tarahalla.â€™ â€˜Valhalla, I can remember. Do the females have horns?â€™ â€˜Sure, but you canâ€™t make a mistake. The bull is black and theyâ€™re brown. You canâ€™t go wrong.â€™ â€˜Has Mâ€™Cola ever seen one?â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t think so. Youâ€™ve got four on your licence. Any time you can better one, go ahead.â€™ â€˜Are they hard to kill?â€™ â€˜Theyâ€™re tough. Theyâ€™re not like a kudu. If youâ€™ve got one down be careful how you walk up to him.â€™ â€˜What about time?â€™ â€˜Weâ€™ve got to get out. Make it back to-morrow night if you can. Use your own judgment. I think this is the turning point. Youâ€™ll get a kudu.â€™ â€˜Do you know what itâ€™s like?â€™ I said. â€˜Itâ€™s just like when we were kids and we heard about a river no one had ever fished out on the huckleberry plain beyond the Sturgeon and the Pigeon.â€™ â€˜How did the river turn out?â€™ â€˜Listen. We had a hell of a time to get in and the night we got there, just before dark, and saw it, there was a deep pool and a long straight stretch and the water so cold you couldnâ€™t keep your hand in it and I threw a cigarette butt in and a big trout hit it and they kept snapping it up and spitting it out as it floated until it went to pieces.â€™ â€˜Big trout?â€™ â€˜The biggest kind.â€™ â€˜God save us,â€™ said Pop. â€˜What did you do then?â€™ â€˜Rigged up my rod and made a cast and it was dark, and there was a nighthawk swooping around and it was cold as a bastard and then I was fast to three fish the second the flies hit the water.â€™ â€˜Did you land them?â€™ â€˜The three of them.â€™ â€˜You damned liar.â€™ â€˜I swear to God.â€™ â€˜I believe you. Tell me the rest when you come back. Were they big trout?â€™ â€˜The biggest bloody kind.â€™ â€˜God save us,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Youâ€™re going to get a kudu. Get started.â€™ In the tent I found P.O.M. and told her. â€˜Not really?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜Hurry up,â€™ she said. â€˜Donâ€™t talk. Get started.â€™ I found raincoat, extra boots, socks, bathrobe, bottle of quinine tablets, citronella, note book, a pencil, my solids, the cameras, the emergency kit, knife, matches, extra shirt and undershirt, a book, two candles, money, the flask . . . â€˜What else?â€™ â€˜Have you got soap? Take a comb and a towel. Got handkerchiefs?â€™ â€˜All right.â€™ Molo had everything packed in a rucksack and I found my field glasses, Mâ€™Cola taking Popâ€™s big field glasses, a canteen with water and Kati sending a chop-box with food. â€˜Take plenty of beer,â€™ Pop said. â€˜You can leave it in the car. Weâ€™re short on whisky but thereâ€™s a bottle.â€™ â€˜How will that leave you?â€™ â€˜All right. Thereâ€™s more at the other camp. We sent two bottles on with Mr. K.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ll only need the flask,â€™ I said. â€˜Weâ€™ll split the bottle.â€™ â€˜Take plenty of beer then. Thereâ€™s any amount of it.â€™ â€˜Whatâ€™s the bastard doing?â€™ I said, pointing at Garrick who was getting into the car. â€˜He says you and Mâ€™Cola wont be able to talk with the natives there. Youâ€™ll have to have some one to interpret.â€™ â€˜Heâ€™s poison.â€™ â€˜You will need someone to interpret whatever they speak into Swahili.â€™ â€˜All right. But tell him heâ€™s not running the show and to keep his bloody mouth shut.â€™ â€˜Weâ€™ll go to the top of the hill with you,â€™ Pop said and we started off, the Wanderobo hanging to the side of the car. â€˜Going to pick the old man up in the village.â€™ Everyone in camp was out to watch us go. â€˜Have we plenty of salt?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ Now we were standing by the car on the road in the village waiting for the old man and Garrick to come back from their huts. It was early afternoon and the sky was clouding over and I was looking at P.O.M., very desirable, cool, and neat-looking in her khaki and her boots, her Stetson on one side of her head, and at Pop, big, thick, in the faded corduroy sleeveless jacket that was almost white now from washing and the sun. â€˜You be a good girl.â€™ â€˜Donâ€™t ever worry. I wish I could go.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s a one-man show,â€™ Pop said. â€˜You want to get in fast and do the dirty and get out fast. Youâ€™ve a big load as it is.â€™ The old man appeared and got into the back of the car with Mâ€™Cola who was wearing my old khaki sleeveless, quail-shooting coat. â€˜Mâ€™Colaâ€™s got the old manâ€™s coat,â€™ Pop said. â€˜He likes to carry things in the game pockets,â€™ I said. Mâ€™Cola saw we were talking about him. I had forgotten about the uncleaned rifle. Now I remembered it and said to Pop, â€˜Ask him where he got the new coatâ€™. Mâ€™Cola grinned and said something. â€˜He says it is his property.â€™ I grinned at him and he shook his old bald head and it was understood that I had said nothing about the rifle. â€˜Whereâ€™s that bastard Garrick?â€™ I asked. Finally he came with his blanket and got in with Mâ€™Cola and the old man behind. The Wanderobo sat with me in front beside Kamau. â€˜Thatâ€™s a lovely-looking friend you have,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜You be good too.â€™ I kissed her good-bye and we whispered something. â€˜Billing and cooing,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Disgusting.â€™ â€˜Good-bye, you old bastard.â€™ â€˜Good-bye, you damned bullfighter.â€™ â€˜Good-bye, sweet.â€™ â€˜Good-bye and good luck.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™ve plenty of petrol and weâ€™ll leave some here,â€™ Pop called. I waved and we were starting down hill through the village on a narrow track that led down and on to the scrubby dry plain that spread out below the two great blue hills. I looked back as we went down the hill and saw the two figures, the tall thick one and the small neat one, each wearing big Stetson hats, silhouetted on the road as they walked back toward camp, then I looked ahead at the dried-up, scrubby plain. PART IV PURSUIT AS HAPPINESS CHAPTER ONE The road was only a track and the plain was very discouraging to see. As we went on we saw a few thin Grantâ€™s gazelles showing white against the burnt yellow of the grass and the grey trees. My exhilaration died with the stretching out of this plain, the typical poor game country, and it all began to seem very impossible and romantic and quite untrue. The Wanderobo had a very strong odour and I looked at the way the lobes of his ear were stretched and then neatly wrapped on themselves and at his strange un-negroid, thin-lipped face. When he saw me studying his face he smiled pleasantly and scratched his chest. I looked around at the back of the car. Mâ€™Cola was asleep. Garrick was sitting straight up, dramatizing his awakeness, and the old man was trying to see the road. By now there was no more road, only a cattle track, but we were coming to the edge of the plain. Then the plain was behind us and ahead there were big trees and we were entering a country the loveliest that I had seen in Africa. The grass was green and smooth, short as a meadow that has been mown and is newly grown, and the trees were big, high-trunked, and old with no undergrowth but only the smooth green of the turf like a deer park and we drove on through shade and patches of sunlight following a faint trail the Wanderobo pointed out. I could not believe we had suddenly come to any such wonderful country. It was a country to wake from, happy to have had the dream and, seeing if it would clown away, I reached up and touched the Wanderoboâ€™s ear. He jumped and Kamau snickered. Mâ€™Cola nudged me from the back seat and pointed and there, standing in an open space between the trees, his head up, staring at us, the bristles on his back erect, long, thick, white tusks upcurving, his eyes showing bright, was a very large wart-hog boar watching us from less than twenty yards. I motioned to Kamau to stop and we sat looking at him and he at us. I put the rifle up and sighted on his chest. He watched and did not move. Then I motioned to Kamau to throw in the clutch and we went on and made a curve to the right and left the wart-hog, who had never moved, nor showed any fright at seeing us. I could see that Kamau was excited and, looking back, Mâ€™Cola nodded his head up and down in agreement. None of us had ever seen a wart-hog that would not bolt off, fast-trotting, tail in air. This was a virgin country, an un-hunted pocket in the million miles of bloody Africa. I was ready to stop and make camp anywhere. This was the finest country I had seen but we went on, winding along through the big trees over the softly rolling grass. Then ahead and to the right we saw the high stockade of a Masai village. It was a very large village and out of it came running long-legged, brown, smooth-moving men who all seemed to be of the same age and who wore their hair in a heavy club-like queue that swung against their shoulders as they ran. They came up to the car and surrounded it, all laughing and smiling and talking. They all were tall, their teeth were white and good, and their hair was stained a red brown and arranged in a looped fringe on their foreheads. They carried spears and they were very handsome and extremely jolly, not sullen, nor contemptuous like the northern Masai, and they wanted to know what we were going to do. The Wanderobo evidently said we were hunting kudu and were in a hurry. They had the car surrounded so we could not move. One said something and three or four others joined in and Kamau explained to me that they had seen two kudu bulls go along the trail in the afternoon. â€˜It canâ€™t be true,â€™ I said to myself. â€˜It canâ€™t be.â€™ I told Kamau to start and slowly we pushed through them, they all laughing and trying to stop the car, making it all but run over them. They were the tallest, best-built, handsomest people I had ever seen and the first truly light-hearted happy people I had seen in Africa. Finally, when we were moving, they started to run beside the car smiling and laughing and showing how easily they could run and then, as the going was better, up the smooth valley of a stream, it became a contest and one after another dropped out of the running, waving and smiling as they left until there were only two still running with us, the finest runners of the lot, who kept pace easily with the car as they moved long-legged, smoothly, loosely, and with pride. They were running too, at the pace of a fast miler, and carrying their spears as well. Then we had to turn to the right and climb out of the putting-green smoothness of the valley into a rolling meadow and, as we slowed, climbing in first gear, the whole pack came up again, laughing and trying not to seem winded. We went through a little knot of brush and a small rabbit started out, zigzagging wildly and all the Masai behind now in a mad sprint. They caught the rabbit and the tallest runner came up with him to the car and handed him to me. I held him and could feel the thumping of his heart through the soft, warm, furry body, and as I stroked him the Masai patted my arm. Holding him by the ears I handed him back. No, no, he was mine. He was a present. I handed him to Mâ€™Cola. Mâ€™Cola did not take him seriously and handed him to one of the Masai. We were moving and they were running again now. The Masai stooped and put the rabbit on the ground and as he ran free they all laughed. Mâ€™Cola shook his head. We were all very impressed by these Masai. â€˜Good Masai,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said, very moved. â€˜Masai many cattle. Masai no kill to eat. Masai kill man.â€™ The Wanderobo patted himself on the chest. â€˜Wanderobo . . . Masai,â€™ he said, very proudly, claiming kin. His ears were curled in the same way theirs were. Seeing them running and so damned handsome and so happy made us all happy. I had never seen such quick disinterested friendliness, nor such fine-looking people. â€˜Good Masai,â€™ Mâ€™Cola repeated, nodding his head emphatically. â€™Good, good Masai.â€™ Only Garrick seemed impressed in a different way. For all his khaki clothes and his letter from Bâ€™wana Simba, I believe these Masai frightened him in a very old place. They were our friends, not his. They certainly were our friends though. They had that attitude that makes brothers, that unexpressed but instant and complete acceptance that you must be Masai wherever it is you come from. That attitude you only get from the best of the English, the best of the Hungarians and the very best Spaniards; the thing that used to be the most clear distinction of nobility when there was nobility. It is an ignorant attitude and the people who have it do not survive, but very few pleasanter things ever happen to you than the encountering of it. So now there were only the two of them left again, running, and it was hard going and the machine was beating them. They were still running well and still loose and long but the machine was a cruel pacemaker. So I told Kamau to speed it up and get it over with because a sudden burst of speed was not the humiliation of a steady using. They sprinted, were beaten, laughed, and then we were leaning out, waving, and they stood leaning on their spears and waved. We were still great friends but now we were alone again and there was no track, only the general direction to follow around clumps of trees and along the run of this green valley. After a little the trees grew closer and we left the idyllic country behind and now were picking our way along a faint trail through thick second-growth. Sometimes we came to a dead halt and had to get out and pull a log out of the way or cut a tree that blocked the body of the car. Sometimes we had to back out of bush and look for a way to circle around and come upon the trail again, chopping our way through with the long brush knives that are called pangas. The Wanderobo was a pitiful chopper and Garrick was little better. Mâ€™Cola did everything well in which a knife was used and he swung a panga with a fast yet heavy and vindictive stroke. I used it badly. There was too much wrist in it to learn it quickly; your wrist tired and the blade seemed to have a weight it did not have. I wished that I had a Michigan double-bitted axe, honed razor-sharp, to chop with instead of this sabring of trees. Chopping through when we were stopped, avoiding all we could, Kamau driving with intelligence and a sound feeling for the country, we came through the difficult going and out into another open-meadow stretch and could see a range of hills off to our right. But here there had been a recent heavy rain and we had to be very careful about the low parts of the meadow where the tyres cut in through the turf to mud and spun in the slick greasiness. We cut brush and shovelled out twice and then, having learned not to trust any low part, we skirted the high edge of the meadow and then were in timber again. As we came out, after several long circles in the woods to find places where we could get the car through, we were on the bank of a stream, where there was a sort of brushy bridging across the bed built like a beaver dam and evidently designed to hold back the water. On the other side was a thorn-brush-fenced cornfield, a steep, stump-scattered bank with corn planted all over it and some abandoned looking corrals or thorn-bush-fenced enclosures with mud and stick buildings and to the right there were cone-shaped grass huts projecting above a heavy thorn fence. We all got out, for this stream was a problem, and, on the other side, the only place we could get up the bank led through the stump-filled maize field. The old man said the rain had come that day. There had been no water going over the brushy dam when they had passed that morning. I was feeling fairly depressed. Here we had come through a beautiful country of virgin timber where kudu had been once seen walking along the trail to end up stuck on the bank of a little creek in someoneâ€™s cornfield. I had not expected any cornfield and I resented it. I thought we would have to get permission to drive through the maize, provided we could make it across the stream and up the bank and I took off my shoes and waded across the stream to test it underfoot. The brush and saplings on the bottom were packed hard and firm and I was sure we could cross if we took it fairly fast. Mâ€™Cola and Kamau agreed and we walked up the bank to see how it would be. The mud of the bank was soft but there was dry earth underneath and I figured we could shovel our way up if we could get through the stumps. But we would need to unload before we tried it. Coming toward us, from the direction of the huts, were two men and a boy. I said â€˜Jamboâ€™, as they came up. They answered â€˜Jamboâ€™, and then the old man and the Wanderobo talked with them. Mâ€™Cola shook his head at me. He did not understand a word. I thought we were asking permission to go through the corn. When the old man finished talking the two men came closer and we shook hands. They looked like no negroes I had ever seen. Their faces were a grey brown, the oldest looked to be about fifty, had thin lips, an almost Grecian nose, rather high cheekbones, and large, intelligent eyes. He had great poise and dignity and seemed to be very intelligent. The younger man had the same cast of features and I took him for a younger brother. He looked about thirty-five. The boy was as pretty as a girl and looked rather shy and stupid. I had thought he was a girl from his face for an instant when he first came up, as they all wore a sort of Roman toga of unbleached muslin gathered at the shoulder that revealed no line of their bodies. They were talking with the old man, who, now that I looked at him standing with them, seemed to bear a sort of wrinkled and degenerate resemblance to the classic-featured owner of the shamba; just as the Wanderobo-Masai was a shrivelled caricature of the handsome Masai we had met in the forest. Then we all went down to the stream and Kamau and I rigged ropes around the tyres to act as chains while the Roman elder and the rest unloaded the car and carried the heaviest things up the steep bank. Then we crossed in a wild, water-throwing smash and, all pushing heavily, made it halfway up the bank before we stuck. We chopped and dug out and finally made it to the top of the bank but ahead was that maize field and I could not figure where we were to go from there. â€˜Where do we go?â€™ I asked the Roman elder. They did not understand Garrickâ€™s interpreting and the old man made the question clear. The Roman pointed toward the heavy thorn-bush fence to the left at the edge of the woods. â€˜We canâ€™t get through there in the car.â€™ â€˜Campi,â€™ said Mâ€™Cola, meaning we were going to camp there. â€˜Hell of a place,â€™ I said. â€˜Campi,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said firmly and they all nodded. â€˜Campi! Campi!â€™ said the old man. â€˜There we camp,â€™ Garrick announced pompously. â€˜You go to hell,â€™ I told him cheerfully. I walked toward the camp site with the Roman who was talking steadily in a language I could not understand a word of. Mâ€™Cola was with me and the others were loading and following with the car. I was remembering that I had read you must never camp in abandoned native quarters because of ticks and other hazards and I was preparing to hold out against this camp. We entered a break in the thorn-bush fence and inside was a building of logs and saplings stuck in the ground and crossed with branches. It looked like a big chicken coop. The Roman made us free of this and of the enclosure with a wave of his hand and kept on talking. â€˜Bugs,â€™ I said to Mâ€™Cola in Swahili, speaking with strong disapproval. â€˜No,â€™ he said, dismissing the idea. â€˜No bugs.â€™ â€˜Bad bugs. Many bugs. Sickness.â€™ â€˜No bugs,â€™ he said firmly. The no-bugs had it and with the Roman talking steadily, I hoped on some congenial topic, the car came up, stopped under a huge tree about fifty yards from the thorn-bush fence and they all commenced carrying the necessities in for the making of camp. My ground-sheet tent was slung between a tree and one side of the chicken coop and I sat down on a petrol case to discuss the shooting situation with the Roman, the old man, and Garrick, while Kamau and Mâ€™Cola fixed up a camp and the Wanderobo-Masai stood on one leg and let his mouth hang open. â€˜Where were kudu?â€™ â€˜Back there,â€™ waving his arm. â€˜Big ones?â€™ Arms spread to show hugeness of horns and a torrent from the Roman. Me, dictionary-ing heavily, â€˜Where was the one they were watching?â€™ No results on this but a long speech from the Roman which I took to mean they were watching them all. It was late afternoon now and the sky was heavy with clouds. I was wet to the waist and my socks were mud soaked. Also I was sweating from pushing on the car and from chopping. â€˜When do we start?â€™ I asked. â€˜To-morrow,â€™ Garrick answered without bothering to question the Roman. â€˜No,â€™ I said. â€˜To-night.â€™ â€˜To-morrow,â€™ Garrick said. â€˜Late now. One hour light.â€™ He showed me one hour on my watch. I dictionaried. â€˜Hunt to-night. Last hour best hour.â€™ Garrick implied that the kudu were too far away. That it was impossible to hunt and return, all this with gestures, â€˜Hunt to-morrowâ€™. â€˜You bastard,â€™ I said in English. All this time the Roman and the old man had been standing saying nothing. I shivered. It was cold with the sun under the clouds in spite of the heaviness of the air after rain. â€˜Old man,â€™ I said. â€˜Yes, Master,â€™ said the old man. Dictionary-ing carefully, I said, â€˜Hunt kudu to-night. Last hour best hour. Kudu close?â€™ â€˜Maybe.â€™ â€˜Hunt now?â€™ They talked together. â€˜Hunt to-morrow,â€™ Garrick put in. â€˜Shut up, you actor,â€™ I said. â€˜Old man. Little hunt now?â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ said the old man and Roman nodded. â€˜Little while.â€™ â€˜Good,â€™ I said, and went to find a shirt and undershirt and a pair of socks. â€˜Hunt now,â€™ I told Mâ€™Cola. â€˜Good,â€™ he said. â€˜Mâ€™uzuri.â€™ With the clean feeling of dry shirt, fresh socks and a change of boots I sat on the petrol case and drank a whisky and water while I waited for the Roman to come back. I felt certain I was going to have a shot at kudu and I wanted to take the edge off so I would not be nervous. Also I wanted not to catch a cold. Also I wanted the whisky for itself, because I loved the taste of it and because, being as happy as I could be, it made me feel even better. I saw the Roman coming and I pulled the zippers up on my boots, checked the cartridges in the magazine of the Springfield, took off the foresight protector and blew through the rear aperture. Then I drank what was left in the tin cup that was on the ground by the box and stood up, checking that I had a pair of handkerchiefs in my shirt pockets. Mâ€™Cola came carrying his knife and Popâ€™s big glasses. â€˜You stay here,â€™ I said to Garrick. He did not mind. He thought we were silly to go out so late and he was glad to prove us wrong. The Wanderobo wanted to go. â€˜Thatâ€™s plenty,â€™ I said, and waved the old man back and we started out of the corral with the Roman ahead, carrying a spear, then me, then Mâ€™Cola with glasses and the Mannlicher, full of solids, and last the Wanderobo-Masai with another spear. It was after five when we struck off across the maize field and down to the stream, crossing where it narrowed in a high grass a hundred yards above the dam and then, walking slowly and carefully, went up the grassy bank on the far side, getting soaked to the waist as we stooped going through the wet grass and bracken. We had not been gone ten minutes and were moving carefully up the stream bank, when, without warning, the Roman grabbed my arm and pulled me bodily down to the ground as he crouched; me pulling back the bolt to cock the rifle as I dropped. Holding his breath he pointed and across the stream on the far bank at the edge of the trees was a large, grey animal, white stripes showing on his flanks and huge horns curling back from his head as he stood, broadside to us, head up, seeming to be listening. I raised the rifle, but there was a bush in the way of the shot. I could not shoot over the bush without standing. â€˜Piga,â€™ whispered Mâ€™Cola. I shook my finger and commenced to crawl forward to be clear of the bush, sick afraid the bull would jump while I was trying to make the shot certain, but remembering Popâ€™s â€˜Take your timeâ€™. When I saw I was clear I got on one knee, saw the bull through the aperture, marvelling at how big he looked, and then, remembering not to have it matter, that it was the same as any other shot, I saw the bead centred exactly where it should be just below the top of the shoulder and squeezed off. At the roar he jumped and was going into the brush, but I knew I had hit him. I shot at a show of grey between the trees as he went in and Mâ€™Cola was shouting, â€˜Piga! Piga!â€™ meaning â€˜Heâ€™s hit! Heâ€™s hit!â€™ and the Roman was slapping me on the shoulder, then he had his toga up around his neck and was running naked, and the four of us were running now, full speed, like hounds, splashing across the stream, tearing up the bank, the Roman ahead, crashing naked through the brush, then stooping and holding up a leaf with bright blood, slamming me on the back, Mâ€™Cola saying, â€˜Damu! Damu!â€™ (blood, blood), then the deep cut tracks off to the right, me reloading, we all trailing in a dead run, it almost dark in the timber, the Roman, confused a moment by the trail, making a cast off to the right, then picking up blood once more, then pulling me down again with a jerk on my arm and none of us breathing as we saw him standing in a clearing a hundred yards ahead, looking to me hard-hit and looking back, wide ears spread, big, grey, white-striped, his horns a marvel, as he looked straight toward us over his shoulder. I thought I must make absolutely sure this time, now, with the dark coming and I held my breath and shot him a touch behind the fore-shoulder. We heard the bullet smack and saw him buck heavily with the shot. Mâ€™Cola shouted, â€˜Piga! Piga! Piga!â€™ as he went out of sight and as we ran again, like hounds, we almost fell over something. It was a huge, beautiful kudu bull, stone-dead, on his side, his horns in great dark spirals, widespread and unbelievable as he lay dead five yards from where we stood when I had just that instant shot. I looked at him, big, long-legged, a smooth grey with the white stripes and the great curling, sweeping horns, brown as walnut meats, and ivory pointed, at the big ears and the great, lovely heavy-maned neck, the white chevron between his eyes and the white of his muzzle and I stooped over and touched him to try to believe it. He was lying on the side where the bullet had gone in and there was not a mark on him and he smelled sweet and lovely like the breath of cattle and the odour of thyme after rain. Then the Roman had his arms around my neck and Mâ€™Cola was shouting in a strange high sing-song voice and Wanderobo-Masai kept slapping me on the shoulder and jumping up and down and then one after the other they all shook hands in a strange way that I had never known in which they took your thumb in their fist and held it and shook it and pulled it and held it again, while they looked you in the eyes, fiercely. We all looked at him and Mâ€™Cola knelt and traced the curve of his horns with his finger and measured the spread with his arms and kept crooning, â€˜Oo-oo-eee-eeeâ€™, making small high noises of ecstasy and stroking the kuduâ€™s muzzle and his mane. I slapped the Roman on the back and we went through the thumb-pulling again; me pulling his thumb too. I embraced the Wanderobo-Masai and he, after a thumb-pulling of great intensity and feeling, slapped his chest and said very proudly, â€˜Wanderobo-Masai wonderful guideâ€™. â€˜Wanderobo-Masai wonderful Masai,â€™ I said. Mâ€™Cola kept shaking his head, looking at the kudu and making the strange small noises. Then he said, â€˜Doumi, Doumi, Doumi! Bâ€™wana Kabor Kidogo, Kidogoâ€™. Meaning this was a bull of bulls. That Karlâ€™s had been a little one, a nothing. We all knew we had killed the other kudu that I had mistaken for this one, while this first one was lying dead from the first shot, and it seemed of no importance beside the miracle of this kudu. But I wanted to see the other. â€˜Come on, kudu,â€™ I said. â€˜Heâ€™s dead,â€™ said Mâ€™Cola. â€˜Kufa!â€™ â€˜Come on.â€™ â€˜This one best.â€™ â€˜Come on.â€™ â€˜Measure,â€™ Mâ€™Cola pleaded. I ran the steel tape around the curve of one horn, Mâ€™Cola holding it down. It was well over fifty inches. Mâ€™Cola looked at me anxiously. â€˜Big! Big!â€™ I said. â€˜Twice as big as Bâ€™wana Kabor.â€™ â€˜Eee-eee,â€™ he crooned. â€˜Come on,â€™ I said. The Roman was off already. We cut for where we saw the bull when I shot and there were the tracks with blood breast high on the leaves in the brush from the start. In a hundred yards we came on him absolutely dead. He was not quite as big as the first bull. The horns were as long, but narrower, but he was as beautiful, and he lay on his side, bending down the brush where he fell. We all shook hands again, using the thumb which evidently denoted extreme emotion. â€˜This askari,â€™ Mâ€™Cola explained. This bull was the policeman or bodyguard for the bigger one. He had evidently been in the timber when we had seen the first bull, had run with him, and had looked back to see why the big bull did not follow. I wanted pictures and told Mâ€™Cola to go back to camp with the Roman and bring the two cameras, the Graflex and the cinema camera and my flashlight. I knew we were on the same side of the stream and above the camp and I hoped the Roman could make a short cut and get back before the sun set. They went off and now, at the end of the day, the sun came out brightly below the clouds and the Wanderobo-Masai and I looked at this kudu, measured his horns, smelled the fine smell of him, sweeter than an eland even, stroked his nose, his neck, and his shoulder, marvelling at his great ears, and the smoothness and cleanness of his hide, looked at his hooves, that were built long, narrow, and springy, so he seemed to walk on tip-toe, felt under his shoulder for the bullet-hole and then shook hands again while the Wanderobo-Masai told what a man he was and I told him he was my pal and gave him my best four-bladed pocket knife. â€˜Letâ€™s go look at the first one, Wanderobo-Masai,â€™ I said in English. The Wanderobo-Masai nodded, understanding perfectly, and we trailed back to where the big one lay in the edge of the little clearing. We circled him, looking at him and then the Wanderobo-Masai, reaching underneath while I held the shoulder up, found the bullet hole and put his finger in. Then he touched his forehead with the bloody finger and made the speech about â€˜Wanderobo-Masai wonderful guide!â€™ â€˜Wanderobo-Masai king of guides,â€™ I said. â€˜Wanderobo-Masai my pal.â€™ I was wet through with sweat and I put on my raincoat that Mâ€™Cola had been carrying and left behind and turned the collar up around my neck. I was watching the sun now and worrying about it being gone before they got up with the cameras. In a little while we could hear them coming in the brush and I shouted to let them know where we were. Mâ€™Cola answered and we shouted although tired, enjoyed as always his fast, clean, delicate scalpeling with the knife, until, the cape all clear and spread back he nocked through the connection of the skull and the spine and then, twisting with the horns, swung the head loose and lifted it, cape and all, free from the neck, the cape hanging heavy and wet in the light of the electric torch that shone on his red hands and on the dirty khaki of his tunic. We left the Wanderobo-Masai, Garrick, the Roman, and his brother with a lantern to skin out and pack in the meat and Mâ€™Cola with a head, the old man with a head, and me with the flashlight and the two guns, we started in the dark back for camp. In the dark the old man fell flat and Mâ€™Cola laughed; then the cape unrolled and came down over his face and he almost choked and we both laughed. The old man laughed too. Then Mâ€™Cola fell in the dark and the old man and I laughed. A little farther on I went through the covering on some sort of game pit and went flat on my face and got up to hear Mâ€™Cola chuckling and choking and the old man giggling. â€˜What the hell is this? A Chaplin comedy?â€™ I asked them in English. They were both laughing under the heads. We got to the thorn-bush fence, finally, after a nightmare march through the brush and saw the fire at the camp and Mâ€™Cola seemed to be delighted when the old man fell going through the thorns and got up cursing and seeming barely able to lift the head as I shone the flash ahead of him to show him the opening. We came up to the fire and I could see the old manâ€™s face bleeding as he put the head down against the stick and mud cabin. Mâ€™Cola put his head down, pointed at the old manâ€™s face and laughed and shook his head. I looked at the old man. He was completely done-in, his face was badly scratched, covered with mud and bleeding, and he was chuckling happily. â€˜Bâ€™wana fell down,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said and imitated me pitching forward. They both chuckled. I made as though to take a swing at him and said, â€˜Shenzi!â€™ He imitated me falling down again and then there was Kamau shaking hands very gently and respectfully and saying, â€˜Good, Bâ€™wana! Very good, Bâ€™wana!â€™ and then going over to the heads, his eyes shining and kneeling, stroking the horns and feeling the ears and crooning the same, sighing, â€˜Ooo-ooo! Eee-eee!â€™ noises Mâ€™Cola had made. I went into the dark of the tent, we had left the lantern with the meat bringers, and washed, took off my wet clothes and feeling in the dark in my rucksack found a pair of pyjamas and a bath-robe. I came out to the fire wearing these and mosquito boots. I brought my wet things and my boots to the fire and Kamau spread them on sticks, and put the boots, each one leg-down, on a stick and back far enough from the blaze where the fire would not scorch them. In the firelight I sat on a petrol box with my back against a tree and Kamau brought the whisky flask and poured some in a cup and I added water from the canteen and sat drinking and looking in the fire, not thinking, in complete happiness, feeling the whisky warm me and smooth me as you straighten the wrinkled sheet in a bed, while Kamau brought tins from the provisions to see what I would eat for supper. There were three tins of Christmas special mincemeat, three tins of salmon, and three of mixed fruit, there were also a number of cakes of chocolate and a tin of Special Christmas Plum Pudding. I sent these back wondering what Kati had imagined the mincemeat to be. We had been looking for that plum pudding for two months. â€˜Meat?â€™ I asked. Kamau brought a thick, long chunk of roast Grant gazelle tenderloin from one of the Grant Pop had shot on the plain while we had been hunting the twenty-five-mile salt-lick, and some bread. â€˜Beer?â€™ He brought one of the big German litre bottles and opened it. It seemed too complicated sitting on the petrol case and I spread my raincoat on the ground in front of the fire where the ground had been dried by the heat and stretched my legs out, leaning my back against the wooden case. The old man was roasting meat on a stick. It was a choice piece he had brought with him wrapped in his toga. In a little while they all began to come in carrying meat and the hides and then I was stretched out drinking beer and watching the fire and all around they were talking and roasting meat on sticks. It was getting cold and the night was clear and there was the smell of the roasting meat, the smell of the smoke of the fire, the smell of my boots steaming, and, where he squatted close, the smell of the good old Wanderobo-Masai. But I could remember the odour of the kudu as he lay in the woods. Each man had his own meat or collection of pieces of meat on sticks stuck around the fire, they turned them and tended them, and there was much talking. Two others that I had not seen had come over from the huts and the boy we had seen in the afternoon was with them. I was eating a piece of hot broiled liver I had lifted from one of the sticks of the Wanderobo-Masai and wondering where the kidneys were. The liver was delicious. I was wondering whether it was worth while getting up to get the dictionary to ask about the kidneys when Mâ€™Cola said, â€˜Beer?â€™ â€˜All right.â€™ He brought the bottle, opened it, and I lifted it and drank half of it off to chase down that liver. â€˜Itâ€™s a hell of a life,â€™ I told him in English. He grinned and said, â€˜More beer?â€™ in Swahili. My talking English to him was an acceptable joke. â€˜Watch,â€™ I said, and tipped the bottle up and let it all go down. It was an old trick we learned in Spain drinking out of wine skins without swallowing. This impressed the Roman greatly. He came over, squatted down by the raincoat and started to talk. He talked for a long time. â€˜Absolutely,â€™ I told him in English. â€˜And furthermore he can take the sleigh.â€™ â€˜More beer?â€™ Mâ€™Cola asked. â€˜You want to see the old man tight, I suppose?â€™ â€˜Nâ€™Dio,â€™ he said. â€˜Yes,â€™ pretending to understand the English. â€˜Watch it, Roman.â€™ I started to let the beer go down, saw the Roman following the motion with his own throat, started to choke, barely recovered, and lowered the bottle. â€˜Thatâ€™s all. Canâ€™t do it more than twice in an evening. Makes you liverish.â€™ The Roman went on talking in his language. I heard him say Simba twice. â€˜Simba here?â€™ â€˜No,â€™ he said. â€˜Over there,â€™ waving at the dark, and I could not make out the story. But it sounded very good. â€˜Me plenty Simba,â€™ I said. â€˜Hell of a man with Simba. Ask Mâ€™Cola.â€™ I could feel that I was getting the evening braggies but Pop and P.O.M. werenâ€™t here to listen. It was not nearly so satisfactory to brag when you could not be understood, still it was better than nothing. I definitely had the braggies, on beer, too. â€˜Amazing,â€™ I told the Roman. He went on with his own story. There was a little beer in the bottom of the bottle. â€˜Old Man,â€™ I said. â€˜Mzee.â€™ â€˜Yes, Bâ€™wana,â€™ said the old man. â€˜Hereâ€™s some beer for you. Youâ€™re old enough, so it canâ€™t hurt you.â€™ I had seen the old manâ€™s eyes while he watched me drink and I knew he was another of the same. He took the bottle, drained it to the last bit of froth and crouched by his meat sticks holding the bottle lovingly. â€˜More beer?â€™ asked Mâ€™Cola. â€˜Yes,â€™ I said. â€˜And my cartridges.â€™ The Roman had gone on steadily talking. He could tell a longer story even than Carlos in Cuba. â€˜Thatâ€™s mighty interesting,â€™ I told him. â€˜Youâ€™re a hell of a fellow, too. Weâ€™re both good. Listen.â€™ Mâ€™Cola had brought the beer and my khaki coat with the cartridges in the pocket. I drank a little beer, noted the old man watching and spread out six cartridges. â€˜Iâ€™ve got the braggies,â€™ I said. â€˜You have to stand for this, look!â€™ I touched each of the cartridges in turn, â€˜Simba, Simba, Faro, Nyati, Tendalla, Tendalla. What do you think of that? You donâ€™t have to believe it. Look, Mâ€™Cola!â€™ and I named the six cartridges again. â€˜Lion, lion, rhino, buffalo, kudu, kudu.â€™ â€˜Ayee!â€™ said the Roman excitedly. â€˜Nâ€™Dio,â€™ said Mâ€™Cola solemnly. â€˜Yes, it is true.â€™ â€˜Ayee!â€™ said the Roman and grabbed me by the thumb. â€˜Godâ€™s truth,â€™ I said. â€˜Highly improbable, isnâ€™t it?â€™ â€˜Nâ€™Dio,â€™ said Mâ€™Cola, counting them over himself. â€˜Simba, Simba, Faro, Nyati, Tendalla, Tendalla!â€™ â€˜You can tell the others,â€™ I said in English. â€˜Thatâ€™s a hell of a big piece of bragging. Thatâ€™ll hold me for to-night.â€™ The Roman went on talking to me again and I listened carefully and ate another piece of the broiled liver. Mâ€™Cola was working on the heads now, skinning out one skull and showing Kamau how to skin out the easy part of the other. It was a big job to do for the two of them, working carefully around the eyes and the muzzle and the cartilage of the ears, and afterwards flesh all of the head skins so they would not spoil, and they were working at it very delicately and carefully in the firelight. I do not remember going to bed, nor if we went to bed. I remember getting the dictionary and asking Mâ€™Cola to ask the boy if he had a sister and Mâ€™Cola saying, â€˜No, Noâ€™, to me very firmly and solemnly. â€˜Nothing tendacious, you understand. Curiosity.â€™ Mâ€™Cola was firm. â€˜No,â€™ he said and shook his head. â€˜Hapana,â€™ in the same tone he used when we followed the lion into the sanseviera that time. That disposed of the opportunities for social life and I looked up kidneys and the Romanâ€™s brother produced some from his lot and I put a piece between two pieces of liver on a stick and started it broiling. â€˜Make an admirable breakfast,â€™ I said out loud. â€˜Much better than mincemeat.â€™ Then we had a long talk about sable. The Roman did not call them Tarahalla and that name meant nothing to him. There was some confusion about buffalo because the Roman kept saying â€˜nyatiâ€™, but he meant they were black like the buff. Then we drew pictures in the dust of ashes from the fire and what he meant were sable all right. The horns curved back like scimitars, way back over their withers. â€˜Bulls?â€™ I said. â€˜Bulls and cows.â€™ With the old man and Garrick interpreting, I believed I made out that there were two herds. â€˜To-morrow.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ the Roman said. â€˜To-morrow.â€™ â€˜â€™Cola,â€™ I said. â€˜To-day, kudu. To-morrow, sable, buffalo, Simba.â€™ â€˜Hapana, buffalo!â€™ he said and shook his head. Hapana, Simba!â€™ â€˜Me and the Wanderobo-Masai buffalo,â€™ I said. â€˜Yes,â€™ said the Wanderobo-Masai excitedly. â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜There are very big elephants near here,â€™ Garrick said. â€˜To-morrow, elephants,â€™ I said, teasing Mâ€™Cola. â€˜Hapana elephants!â€™ He knew it was teasing but he did not even want to hear it said. â€˜Elephants,â€™ I said. â€˜Buffalo, Simba, leopard.â€™ The Wanderobo-Masai was nodding excitedly. â€˜Rhino,â€™ he put in. â€˜Hapana!â€™ Mâ€™Cola said shaking his head. He was beginning to suffer. â€˜In those hills many buffalo,â€™ the old man interpreted for the now very excited Roman who was standing and pointing beyond where the huts were. â€˜Hapana! Hapana! Hapana!â€™ Mâ€™Cola said definitely and finally. â€˜More beer?â€™ putting down his knife. â€˜All right,â€™ I said. â€˜Iâ€™m just kidding you.â€™ Mâ€™Cola was crouched close talking, making an explanation. I heard Popâ€™s title and I thought it was that Pop would not like it. That Pop would not want it. â€˜I was just kidding you,â€™ I said in English. Then in Swahili, â€˜To-morrow, sable?â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ he said feelingly. â€˜Yes.â€™ After that the Roman and I had a long talk in which I spoke Spanish and he spoke whatever it was he spoke and I believe we planned the entire campaign for the next day. CHAPTER TWO I do not remember going to bed nor getting up, only being by the fire in the grey before daylight, with a tin cup of hot tea in my hand and my breakfast, on the stick, not looking nearly so admirable and very over-blown with ashes. The Roman was standing making an oration with gestures in the direction where the light was beginning to show and I remember wondering if the bastard had talked all night. The head skins were all spread and neatly salted and the skulls with the horns were leaning against the log and stick house. Mâ€™Cola was folding the head skins. Kamau brought me the tins and I told him to open one of fruit. It was cold from the night and the mixed fruit and the cold syrupy juice sucked down smoothly. I drank another cup of tea, went in the tent, dressed, put on my dry boots and we were ready to start. The Roman had said we would be back before lunch. We had the Romanâ€™s brother as guide. The Roman was going, as near as I could make out, to spy on one of the herds of sable and we were going to locate the other. We started out with the brother ahead, wearing a toga and carrying a spear, then me with the Springfield slung and my small Zeiss glasses in my pocket, then Mâ€™Cola with Popâ€™s glasses, slung on one side, water canteen on the other, skinning knife, whetstone, extra box of cartridges, and cakes of chocolates in his pockets, and the big gun over his shoulder, then the old man with the Graflex, Garrick with the movie camera, and the Wanderobo-Masai with a spear and bow and arrows. We said good-bye to the Roman and started out of the thorn-bush fence just as the sun came through the gap in the hills and shone on the cornfield, the huts and the blue hills beyond. It promised to be a fine clear day. The brother led the way through some heavy brush that soaked us all; then through the open forest, then steeply uphill until we were well up on the slope that rose behind the edge of the field where we were camped. Then we were on a good smooth trail that graded back into these hills above which the sun had not yet risen. I was enjoying the early morning, still a little sleepy, going along a little mechanically and starting to think that we were a very big outfit to hunt quietly, although everyone seemed to move quietly enough, when we saw two people coming towards us. They were a tall, good-looking man with features like the Romanâ€™s, but slightly less noble, wearing a toga and carrying a bow and quiver of arrows, and behind him, his wife, very pretty, very modest, very wifely, wearing a garment of brown tanned skins and neck ornament of concentric copper wire circles and many wire circles on her arms and ankles. We halted, said â€˜Jamboâ€™, and the brother talked to this seeming tribesman who had the air of a business man on the way to his office in the city and, as they spoke in rapid question and answer, I watched the most freshly brideful wife who stood a little in profile so that I saw her pretty pear-shaped breasts and the long, clean niggery legs and was studying her pleasant profile most profitably until her husband spoke to her suddenly and sharply, then in explanation and quiet command, and she moved around us, her eyes down, and went on along the trail that we had come, alone, we all watching her. The husband was going on with us, it seemed. He had seen the sable that morning and, slightly suspicious, obviously displeased at leaving that now out-of-sight wife of wives that we all had taken with our eyes, he led us off and to the right along another trail, well-worn and smooth, through woods that looked like fall at home and where you might expect to flush a grouse and have him whirr off to the other hill or pitch down in the valley. So, sure enough we put up partridges and, watching them fly, I was thinking all the country in the world is the same country and all hunters are the same people. Then we saw a fresh kudu track beside the trail and then, as we moved through the early morning woods, no undergrowth now, the first sun coming through the tops of the trees, we came on the ever miracle of elephant tracks, each one as big around as the circle you make with your arms putting your hands together, and sunk a foot deep in the loam of the forest floor, where some bull had passed, travelling after rain. Looking at the way the tracks graded down through the pleasant forest I thought that we had the mammoths too, a long time ago, and when they travelled through the hills in southern Illinois they made these same tracks. It was just that we were an older country in America and the biggest game was gone. We kept along the face of this hill on a pleasant sort of jutting plateau and then came out to the edge of the hill where there was a valley and a long open meadow with timber on the far side and a circle of hills at its upper end where another valley went off to the left. We stood in the edge of the timber on the face of this hill looking across the meadow valley which extended to the open out in a steep sort of grassy basin at the upper end where it was backed by the hills. To our left there were steep, rounded, wooded hills, with outcroppings of limestone rock that ran, from where we stood, up to the very head of the valley, and there formed part of the other range of hills that headed it. Below us, to the right, the country was rough and broken in hills and stretches of meadow and then a steep fall of timber that ran to the blue hills we had seen to the westward beyond the huts where the Roman and his family lived. I judged camp to be straight down below us and about five miles to the north-west through the timber. The husband was standing, talking to the brother and gesturing and pointing out that he had seen the sable feeding on the opposite side of the meadow valley and that they must have fed either up or down the valley. We sat in the shelter of the trees and sent the Wanderobo-Masai down into the valley to look for tracks. He came back and reported there were no tracks leading down the valley below us and to the westward, so we knew they had fed on up the meadow valley. Now the problem was to so use the terrain that we might locate them, and get up and into range of them without being seen. The sun was coming over the hills at the head of the valley and shone on us while everything at the head of the valley was in heavy shadow. I told the outfit to stay where they were in the woods, except for Mâ€™Cola and the husband who would go with me, we keeping in the timber and grading up our side of the valley until we could be above and see into the pocket of the curve at the upper end to glass it for the sable. You ask how this was discussed, worked out, and understood with the bar of language, and I say it was as freely discussed and clearly understood as though we were a cavalry patrol all speaking the same language. We were all hunters except, possibly, Garrick, and the whole thing could be worked out, understood, and agreed to without using anything but a forefinger to signal and a hand to caution. We left them and worked very carefully ahead, well back in the timber to get height. Then, when we were far enough up and along, we crawled out on to a rocky place and, being behind rock, shielding the glasses with my hat so they would not reflect the sun, Mâ€™Cola nodding and grunting as he saw the practicability of that, we glassed the opposite side of the meadow around the edge of the timber, and up into the pocket at the head of the valley; and there they were. Mâ€™Cola saw them just before I did and pulled my sleeve. â€˜Nâ€™Dio,â€™ I said. Then I held my breath to watch them. All looked very black, big necked, and heavy. All had the back-curving horns. They were a long way away. Some were lying down. One was standing. We could see seven. â€˜Whereâ€™s the bull?â€™ I whispered. Mâ€™Cola motioned with his left hand and counted four fingers. It was one of those lying down in the tall grass and the animal did look much bigger and the horns much more sweeping. But we were looking into the morning sun and it was hard to see well. Behind them a sort of gully ran up into the hill that blocked the end of the valley. Now we knew what we had to do. We must go back, cross the meadow far enough down so we were out of sight, get into the timber on the far side and work along through the timber to get above the sable. First we must try to make sure there were no more of them in the timber or the meadow that we must work through before we made our stalk. I wet my finger and put it up. From the cool side it seemed as though the breeze came down the valley. Mâ€™Cola took some dead leaves and crumpled them and tossed them up. They fell a little toward us. The wind was all right and now we must glass the edge of the timber and check on it. â€˜Hapana,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said finally. I had seen nothing either and my eyes ached from the pull of the eight-power glasses. We could take a chance on the timber. We might jump something and spook the sable but we had to take that chance to get around and above them. We made our way back and down and told the others. From where they were we could cross the valley out of sight of its upper end and bending low, me with my hat off, we headed down into the high meadow grass and across the deeply cut watercourse that ran down through the centre of the meadow, across its rocky shelf, and up the grassy bank on the other side, keeping under the edge of a fold of the valley into the shelter of the woods. Then we headed up through the woods, crouched, in single file, to try to get above the sable. We went forward making as good time as we could and still move quietly. I had made too many stalks on big horn sheep only to find them fed away and out of sight when you came round the shoulder of the mountain to trust these sable to stay where they were and, since once we were in the timber we could no longer see them, I thought it was important that we come up above them as fast as we could without getting me too blown and shaky for the shooting. Mâ€™Colaâ€™s water bottle made a noise against the cartridges in his pocket and I stopped and had him pass it to the Wanderobo-Masai. It seemed too many people to be hunting with, but they all moved quietly as snakes, and I was over-confident anyway. I was sure the sable could not see us in the forest, nor wind us. Finally I was certain we were above them and that they must be ahead of us, and past where the sun was shining in a thinning of the forest, and below us, under the edge of the hill. I checked on the aperture in the sight being clean, cleaned my glasses and wiped the sweat from my forehead remembering to put the used handkerchief in my left pocket so I would not fog my glasses wiping them with it again. Mâ€™Cola and I and the husband started to work our way to the edge of the timber; finally crawling almost to the edge of the ridge. There were still some trees between us and the open meadow below and we were behind a small bush and a fallen tree when, raising our heads, we could see them in the grassy open, about three hundred yards away, showing big and very dark in the shadow. Between us was scattered open timber full of sunlight and the openness of the gulch. As we watched two got to their feet and seemed to be standing looking at us. The shot was possible but it was too long to be certain and as I lay, watching, I felt somebody touch me on the arm and Garrick, who had crawled up, whispered throatily, â€˜Piga! Piga, Bâ€™wana! Doumi! Doumi!â€™ saying to shoot, that it was a bull. I glanced back and there were the whole outfit on their bellies or hands and knees, the Wanderobo-Masai shaking like a bird dog. I was furious and motioned them all down. So that was a bull, eh, well there was a much bigger bull that Mâ€™Cola and I had seen lying down. The two sable were watching us and I dropped my head, I thought they might be getting a flash from my glasses. When I looked up again, very slowly, I shaded my eyes with my hand. The two sable had stopped looking and were feeding. But one looked up again nervously and I saw the dark, heavy-built antelope with scimitar-like horns swung back staring at us. I had never seen a sable. I knew nothing about them, neither whether their eyesight was keen, like a ram who sees you at whatever distance you see him, or like a bull elk who cannot see you at two hundred yards unless you move. I was not sure of their size either, but I judged the range to be all of three hundred yards. I knew I could hit one if I shot from a sitting position or prone, but I could not say where I would hit him. Then Garrick again, â€˜Piga, Bâ€™wana, Piga!â€™ I turned on him as though to slug him in the mouth. It would have been a great comfort to do it. I truly was not nervous when I first saw the sable, but Garrick was making me nervous. â€˜Far?â€™ I whispered to Mâ€™Cola who had crawled up and was lying by me. â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜Shoot?â€™ â€˜No. Glasses.â€™ We both watched, using the glasses guardedly. I could only see four. There had been seven. If that was a bull that Garrick pointed out, then they were all bulls. They all looked the same colour in the shadow. Their horns all looked big to me. I knew that with mountain sheep the rams all kept together in bunches until late in the winter when they went with the ewes; that in the late summer you found bull elk in bunches too, before the rutting season, and that later they herded up together again. We had seen as many as twenty impalla rams together upon the Serenea. All right, then, they could all be bulls, but I wanted a good one, the best one, and I tried to remember having read something about them, but all I could remember was a silly story of some man seeing the same bull every morning in the same place and never getting up on him. All I could remember was the wonderful pair of horns we had seen in the Game Wardenâ€™s office in Arusha. And here were sable now, and I must play it right and get the best one. It never occurred to me that Garrick had never seen a sable and that he knew no more about them than Mâ€™Cola or I. â€˜Too far,â€™ I said to Mâ€™Cola. â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜Come on,â€™ I said, then waved the others down, and we started crawling up to reach the edge of the hill. Finally we lay behind a tree and I looked around it. Now we could see their horns clearly with the glasses and could see the other three. One, lying down, was certainly much the biggest and the horns, as I caught them in silhouette, seemed to curve much higher and farther back. I was studying them, too excited to be happy as I watched them, when I heard Mâ€™Cola whisper â€˜Bâ€™wana.â€™ I lowered the glasses and looked and there was Garrick, taking no advantage of the cover, crawling on his hands and knees out to join us. I put my hand out, palm toward him, and waved him down but he paid no attention and came crawling on, as conspicuous as a man walking down a city street on hands and knees. I saw one sable looking toward us, toward him, rather. Then three more got to their feet. Then the big one got up and stood broadside with head turned toward us as Garrick came up whispering, â€˜Piga, Bâ€™wana! Piga! Doumi! Doumi! Kubwa Sana.â€™ There was no choice now. They were definitely spooked and I lay out flat on my belly, put my arm through the sling, got my elbows settled and my right toe pushing the ground and squeezed off on the centre of the bullâ€™s shoulder. But at the roar I knew it was bad. I was over him. They all jumped and stood looking, not knowing where the noise came from. I shot again at the bull and threw dirt all over him and they were off. I was on my feet and hit him as he ran and he was down. Then he was up and I hit him again and he took it and was in the bunch. They passed him and I shot and was behind him. Then I hit him again and he was trailing slowly and I knew I had him. Mâ€™Cola was handing me cartridges and I was shoving shells down into the damned-to-hell, lousy, staggered, Springfield magazine watching the sable making heavy weather of it crossing the watercourse. We had him all right. I could see he was very sick. The others were trailing up into the timber. In the sunlight on the other side they looked much lighter and the one Iâ€™d shot looked lighter, too. They looked a dark chestnut and the one I had shot was almost black. But he was not black and I felt there was something wrong. I shoved the last shell in and Garrick was trying to grab my hand to congratulate me when, below us across the open space where the gully that we could not see opened on to the head of the valley, sable started to pass at a running stampede. â€˜Good God,â€™ I thought. They all looked like the one I had shot and I was trying to pick a big one. They all looked about the same and they were crowding running and then came the bull. Even in the shadow he was a dead black and shiny as he hit the sun, and his horns swept up high, then back, huge and dark, in two great curves nearly touching the middle of his back. He was a bull all right. God, what a bull. â€˜Doumi,â€™ said Mâ€™Cola in my ear. â€˜Doumi!â€™ I hit him and at the roar he was down. I saw him up, the others passing, spreading out, then bunching. I missed him. Then I saw him going almost straight away up the valley in the tall grass and I hit him again and he went out of sight. The sable now were going up the hill at the head of the valley, up the hill at our right, up the hill in the timber across the valley, spread out and travelling fast. Now that I had seen a bull I knew they all were cows including the first one I had shot. The bull never showed and I was absolutely sure that we would find him where I had seen him go down in the long grass. The outfit were all up and I shook off handshaking and thumb pulling before we started down through the trees and over the edge of the gully and to the meadow on a dead run. My eyes, my mind, and all inside of me were full of the blackness of that sable bull and the sweep of those horns and I was thanking God I had the rifle reloaded before he came out. But it was excited shooting, all of it, and I was not proud of it. I had gotten excited and shot at the whole animal instead of the right place and I was ashamed; but the outfit now were drunk excited. I would have walked but you could not hold them, they were like a pack of dogs as we ran. As we crossed the meadow opening where we had first seen the seven and went beyond where the bull had gone out of sight, the grass suddenly was high and over our heads and every one slowed down. There were two washed-out concealed ravines ten or twelve feet deep that ran down to the watercourse and what had looked a smooth grass-filled basin was very broken, tricky country with grass that was from waist-high to well above our heads. We found blood at once and it led off to the left, across the watercourse and up the hillside on the left toward the head of the valley. I thought that was the first sable but it seemed a wider swing than he had seemed to make when we watched him going from above in the timber. I made a circle to look for the big bull but I could not pick his track from the mass of tracks and in the high grass and the broken terrain it was difficult to figure just where he had gone. They were all for the blood spoor and it was like trying to make badly-trained bird dogs hunt a dead bird when they are crazy to be off after the rest of the covey. â€˜Doumi! Doumi!â€™ I said. â€˜Kubwa Sana! The bull. The big bull.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ everybody agreed. â€˜Here! Here!â€™ The blood spoor that crossed the watercourse. Finally I took that trail thinking we must get them one at a time, and knowing this one was hard hit and the other would keep. Then, too, I might be wrong and this might be the big bull, he might possibly have turned in the high grass and crossed here as we were running down. I had been wrong before, I remembered. We trailed fast up the hillside, into the timber, the blood was splashed freely; made a turn toward the right, climbing steeply, and at the head of the valley in some large rocks jumped a sable. It went scrambling and bounding off through the rocks. I saw in an instant that it was not hit and knew that, in spite of the back-swung dark horns, it was a cow from the dark chestnut colour. But I saw this just in time to keep from shooting. I had started to pull when I lowered the rifle. â€˜Manamouki,â€™ I said. â€˜Itâ€™s a cow.â€™ Mâ€™Cola and the two Roman guides agreed. I had very nearly shot. We went on perhaps five yards and another sable jumped. But this one was swaying its head wildly and could not clear the rocks. It was hard hit and I took my time, shot carefully, and broke its neck. We came up to it, lying in the rocks, a large, deep chestnut-brown animal, almost black, the horns black and curving handsomely back, there was a white patch on the muzzle and back from the eye, there was a white belly; but it was no bull. Mâ€™Cola, still in doubt, verified this and feeling the short, rudimentary teats said â€˜Manamoukiâ€™, and shook his head sadly. It was the first big bull that Garrick had pointed out. â€˜Bull down there,â€™ I pointed. â€˜Yes,â€™ said Mâ€™Cola. I thought that we would give him time to get sick, if he were only wounded, and then go down and find him. So I had Mâ€™Cola make the cuts for taking off the head skin and we would leave the old man to skin out the head while we went down after the bull. I drank some water from the canteen. I was thirsty after the run and the climb, and the sun was up now and it was getting hot. Then we went down the opposite side of the valley from that we had just come up trailing the wounded cow, and below, in the tall grass, casting in circles, commenced to hunt for the trail of the bull. We could not find it. The sable had been running in a bunch as they came out and any individual track was confused or obliterated. We found some blood on the grass stems where I had first hit him, then lost it, then found it again where the other blood spoor turned off. Then the tracks had all split up as they had gone, fan-wise, up the valley and the hills and we could not find it again. Finally I found blood on a grass blade about fifty yards up the valley and I plucked it and held it up. This was a mistake. I should have brought them to it. Already everyone but Mâ€™Cola was losing faith in the bull. He was not there. He had disappeared. He had vanished. Perhaps he had never existed. Who could say he was a real bull? If I had not plucked the grass with the blood on it I might have held them. Growing there with blood on it, it was evidence. Plucked, it meant nothing except to me and to Mâ€™Cola. But I could find no more blood and they were all hunting half-heartedly now. The only possible way was to quarter every foot of the high grass and trace every foot of the gullies. It was very hot now and they were only making a pretence of hunting. Garrick came up. â€˜All cows,â€™ he said. â€˜No bull. Just biggest cow. You killed biggest cow. We found her. Smaller cow get away.â€™ â€˜You wind-blown son of a bitch,â€™ I said, then, using my fingers. â€˜Listen. Seven cows. Then fifteen cows and one bull. Bull hit. Here.â€™ â€˜All cows,â€™ said Garrick. â€˜One big cow hit. One bull hit.â€™ I was so sure sounding that they agreed to this and searched for a while but I could see they were losing belief in the bull. â€˜If I had one good dog,â€™ I thought. â€˜Just one good dog.â€™ Then Garrick came up. â€˜All cows,â€™ he said. â€˜Very big cows.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™re a cow,â€™ I said. â€˜Very big cow.â€™ This got a laugh from the Wanderobo-Masai, who was getting to look a picture of sick misery. The brother half believed in the bull, I could see. Husband, by now, did not believe in any of us. I didnâ€™t think he even believed in the kudu of the night before. Well, after this shooting, I did not blame him. Mâ€™Cola came up. â€˜Hapana,â€™ he said glumly. Then, â€˜Bâ€™wana, you shot that bull?â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ I said. For a minute I began to doubt whether there ever was a bull. Then I saw again his heavy, high-withered blackness and the high rise of his horns before they swept back, him running with the bunch, shoulder higher than them and black as hell and as I saw it, Mâ€™Cola saw it again too through the rising mist of the savageâ€™s unbelief in what he can no longer see. â€˜Yes,â€™ Mâ€™Cola agreed. â€˜I see him. You shoot him.â€™ I told it again. â€˜Seven cows. Shoot biggest. Fifteen cows, one bull. Hit that bull.â€™ They all believed it now for a moment and circled, searching, but the faith died at once in the heat of the sun and the tall grass blowing. â€˜All cows,â€™ Garrick said. The Wanderobo-Masai nodded, his mouth open. I could feel the comfortable lack of faith coming over me too. It was a damned sight easier not to hunt in that sun in that shadeless pocket and in the sun on that steep hillside. I told Mâ€™Cola we would hunt up the valley on both sides, finish skinning out the head, and he and I would come down alone and find the bull. You could not hunt them against that unbelief. I had had no chance to train them; no power to discipline. If there had been no law I would have shot Garrick and they would all have hunted or cleared out. I think they would have hunted. Garrick was not popular. He was simply poison. Mâ€™Cola and I came back down the valley, quartered it like bird dogs, circled and followed and checked track after track. I was hot and very thirsty. The sun was something serious by now. â€˜Hapana,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said. We could not find him. Whatever he was, we had lost him. â€˜Maybe he was a cow. Maybe it was all goofy,â€™ I thought, letting the unbelief come in as a comfort. We were going to hunt up the hill side to the right and then we would have checked it all and would take the cow head into camp and see what the Roman had located. I was dead thirsty and drained the canteen. We would get water in camp. We started up the hill and I jumped a sable in some brush. I almost loosed off at it before I saw it was a cow. That showed how one could be hidden, I thought. We would have to get the men and go over it all again; and then, from the old man, came a wild shouting. â€˜Doumi! Doumi!â€™ in a high, screaming shout. â€˜Where?â€™ I shouted, running across the hill toward him. â€˜There! There!â€™ he shouted, pointing into the timber on the other side of the head of the valley. â€˜There! There! There he goes! There!â€™ We came on a dead run but the bull was out of sight in the timber on the hillside. The old man said he was huge, he was black, he had great horns, and he came by him ten yards away, hit in two places, in the gut and high up in the rump, hard hit but going fast, crossing the valley, through the boulders and going up the hillside. I gut-shot him, I thought. Then as he was going away I laid that one on his stern. He lay down and was sick and we missed him. Then, when we were past, he jumped. â€˜Come on,â€™ I said. Everyone was excited and ready to go now and the old man was chattering about the bull as he folded the head skin and put the head upon his own head and we started across through the rocks and up, quartering up on to the hillside. There, where the old man had pointed, was a very big sable track, the hoof marks spread wide, the tracks grading up into the timber and there was blood, plenty of it. We trailed him fast, hoping to jump him and have a shot, and it was easy trailing in the shade of the trees with plenty of blood to follow. But he kept climbing, grading up around the hill, and he was travelling fast. We kept the blood bright and wet but we could not come up on him. I did not track but kept watching ahead thinking I might see him as he looked back, or see him down, or cutting down across the hill through the timber, and Mâ€™Cola and Garrick were tracking, aided by every one but the old man who staggered along with the sable skull and head skin held on his own grey head. Mâ€™Cola had hung the empty water bottle on him, and Garrick had loaded him with the cinema camera. It was hard going for the old man. Once we came on a place where the bull had rested and watched his back track, there was a little pool of blood on a rock where he had stood, behind some bushes, and I cursed the wind that blew our scent on ahead of us. There was a big breeze blowing now and I was certain we had no chance of surprising him, our scent would keep everything moving out of the way ahead of us as long as anything could move. I thought of trying to circle ahead with Mâ€™Cola and let them track but we were moving fast, the blood was still bright on the stones and on the fallen leaves and grass and the hills were too steep for us to make a circle. I did not see how we could lose him. Then he took us up and into a rocky, ravine-cut country where the trailing was slow and the climbing difficult. Here, I thought, we would jump him in a gully but the spatters of blood, not so bright now, went on around the boulders, over the rocks and up and up and left us on a rim-rock ledge. He must have gone down from there. It was too steep above for him to have gone over the top of the hill. There was no other way to go but down, but how had he gone, and down which ravine? I sent them looking down three possible ways and got out on the rim to try to sight him. They could not find any spoor, and then the Wanderobo-Masai called from below and to the right that he had blood and, climbing down, we saw it on a rock and then followed it in occasional drying splatters down through a steep descent to the meadow below. I was encouraged when he started down hill and in the knee-high, heavy grass of the meadow trailing was easy again, because the grass brushed against his belly and while you could not see tracks clearly without stooping double and parting the grass to look, yet the blood spoor was plain on the grass blades. But it was dry now and dully shiny and I knew we had lost much time on him when he rim-rocked us on the hill. Finally his trail crossed the dry watercourse about where we had first come in sight of the meadow in the morning and led away into the sloping, sparsely-wooded country on the far side. There were no clouds and I could feel the sun now, not just as heat but as a heavy deadly weight on my head and I was very thirsty. It was very hot but it was not the heat that bothered. It was the weight of the sun. Garrick had given up tracking seriously and was only contributing theatrical successes of discovering blood when Mâ€™Cola and I were checked. He would do no routine tracking any more, but would rest and then track in irritating spurts. The Wanderobo-Masai was useless as a blue-jay and I had Mâ€™Cola give him the big rifle to carry so that we would get some use out of him. The Romanâ€™s brother was obviously not a hunter and the husband was not very interested. He did not seem to be a hunter either. As we trailed, slowly, the ground, hard now as the sun had baked it, the blood only black spots and splatters on the short grass, one by one the brother, Garrick, and the Wanderobo-Masai dropped out and sat in the shade of the scattered trees. The sun was terrific and as it was necessary to track with heads bent down and stooping, in spite of a handkerchief spread over my neck I had a pounding ache in my head. Mâ€™Cola was tracking slowly, steadily, and absolutely absorbed in the problem. His bare, bald head gleamed with sweat and when it ran down in his eyes he would pluck a grass stem, hold it with each hand and shave the sweat off his forehead and bald black crown with the stem. We went on slowly. I had always sworn to Pop that I could out-track Mâ€™Cola but I realized now that in the past I had been giving a sort of Garrick performance in picking up the spoor when it was lost and that in straight, steady trailing, now in the heat, with the sun really bad, truly bad so that you could feel what it was doing to your head, cooking it to hell, trailing in short grass on hard ground where a blood spot was a dry, black blister on a grass blade, difficult to see; that you must find the next little black spot perhaps twenty yards away, one holding the last blood while the other found the next, then going on, one on each side of the trail; pointing with a grass stem at the spots to save talking, until it ran out again and you marked the last blood with your eye and both made casts to pick it up again, signalling with a hand up, my mouth too dry to talk, a heat shimmer over the ground now when you straightened up to let your neck stop aching and looked ahead, I knew Mâ€™Cola was immeasurably the better man and the better tracker. Have to tell Pop, I thought. At this point Mâ€™Cola made a joke. My mouth was so dry that it was hard to talk. â€˜Bâ€™wana,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said, looking at me when I had straightened up and was leaning my neck back to get the crick out of it. â€˜Yes?â€™ â€˜Whisky?â€™ and he offered me the flask. â€˜You bastard,â€™ I said in English, and he chuckled and shook his head. â€˜Hapana whisky?â€™ â€˜You savage,â€™ I said in Swahili. We started tracking again, Mâ€™Cola shaking his head and very amused, and in a little while the grass was longer and it was easier again. We crossed all that semi-open country we had seen from the hillside in the morning and going down a slope the tracks swung back into high grass. In this higher grass I found that by half shutting my eyes I could see his trail where he had shouldered through the grass and I went ahead fast without trailing by the blood, to Mâ€™Colaâ€™s amazement, but then we came out on very short grass and rock again and now the trailing was the hardest yet. He was not bleeding much now; the sun and the heat must have dried the wounds and we found only an occasional small starry splatter on the rocky ground. Garrick came up and made a couple of brilliant discoveries of blood spots, then sat down under a tree. Under another tree I could see the poor old Wanderobo-Masai holding his first and last job as gun-bearer. Under another was the old man, the sable head beside him like some black-mass symbol, his equipment hanging from his shoulders. Mâ€™Cola and I went on trailing very slowly and laboriously across the long stony slope and back and up into another tree-scattered meadow, and through it, and into a long field with piled up boulders at the end. In the middle of this field we lost the trail completely and circled and hunted for nearly two hours before we found blood again. The old man found it for us below the boulders and to the right half a mile away. He had gone ahead down there on his own idea of what the bull would have done. The old man was a hunter. Then we trailed him very slowly, on to hard stony ground a mile away. But we could not trail from there. The ground was too hard to leave a track and we never found blood again. Then we hunted on our various theories of where the bull would go, but the country was too big and we had no luck. â€˜No good,â€™ Mâ€™Cola said. I straightened up and went over to the shade of a big tree. It felt cool as water and the breeze cooled my skin through the wet shirt. I was thinking about the bull and wishing to God I had never hit him. Now I had wounded him and lost him. I believe he kept right on travelling and went out of that country. He never showed any tendency to circle back. To-night he would die and the hyenas would eat him, or, worse, they would get him before he died, hamstringing him and pulling his guts out while he was alive. The first one that hit that blood spoor would stay with it until he found him. Then he would call up the others. I felt a son of a bitch to have hit him and not killed him. I did not mind killing anything, any animal, if I killed it cleanly, they all had to die and my interference with the nightly and the seasonal killing that went on all the time was very minute and I had no guilty feeling at all. We ate the meat and kept the hides and horns. But I felt rotten sick over this sable bull. Besides, I wanted him, I wanted him damned badly, I wanted him more than I would admit. Well, we had played our string out with him. Our chance was at the start when he was down and we missed him. We had lost that. No, our best chance, the only chance a rifleman should ever ask, was when I had a shot and shot at the whole animal instead of calling the shot. It was my own lousy fault. I was a son of a bitch to have gut-shot him. It came from over-confidence in being able to do a thing and then omitting one of the steps in how it is done. Well, we had lost him. I doubted if there was a dog in the world could trail him now in that heat. Still that was the only chance. I got out the dictionary and asked the old man if there were any dogs at the Romanâ€™s place. â€˜No,â€™ said the old man. â€˜Hapana.â€™ We made a very wide circle and I sent the brother and the husband out in another circle. We found nothing, no trace, no tracks, no blood, and I told Mâ€™Cola we would start for camp. The Romanâ€™s brother and the husband went up the valley to get the meat of the sable cow we had shot. We were beaten. Mâ€™Cola and I ahead, the other following, we went across the long heat haze of the open country, down to cross the dry watercourse, and up and into the grateful shade of the trail through the woods. As we were going along through the broken sunlight and shadow, the floor of the forest smooth and springy where we cut across to save distance from the trail, we saw, less than a hundred yards away, a herd of sable standing in the timber looking at us. I pulled back the bolt and looked for the best pair of horns. â€˜Doumi,â€™ Garrick whispered. â€˜Doumi kubwa sana!â€™ I looked where he pointed. It was a very big cow sable, dark chestnut, white marks on the face, white belly, heavy built and with a fine curving pair of horns. She was standing broadside to us with her head turned, looking. I looked carefully at the whole lot. They were all cows; evidently the bunch whose bull I had wounded and lost, and they had come over the hill and herded up again together here. â€˜We go to camp,â€™ I said to Mâ€™Cola. As we started forward the sable jumped and ran past us, crossing the trail ahead. At every good pair of cow horns, Garrick said, â€˜Bull, Bâ€™wana. Big, big bull. Shoot, Bâ€™wana. Shoot, oh shoot!â€™ â€˜All cows,â€™ I said to Mâ€™Cola when they were past, running in a panic through the sun-splashed timber. â€˜Yes,â€™ he agreed. â€˜Old man,â€™ I said. The old man came up. â€˜Let the guide carry that,â€™ I said. The old man lowered the cow sable head. â€˜No,â€™ said Garrick. â€˜Yes,â€™ I said. â€˜Bloody well yes.â€™ We went on through the woods toward camp. I was feeling better, much better. All through the day I had never thought once of the kudu. Now we were coming home to where they were waiting. It seemed much longer coming home although, usually, the return over a new trail is shorter. I was tired all the way into my bones, my head felt cooked, and I was thirstier than I had ever been in my life. But suddenly, walking through the woods, it was much cooler. A cloud had come over the sun. We came out of the timber and down on to the flat and in sight of the thorn fence. The sun was behind a bank of clouds now and then in a little while the sky was covered completely and the clouds looked heavy and threatening. I thought perhaps this had been the last clear hot day; unusual heat before the rains. First I thought: if it had only rained, so that the ground would hold a track, we could have stayed with that bull for ever; then, looking at the heavy, woolly clouds that so quickly had covered all the sky, I thought that if we were going to join the outfit, and get the car across that ten-mile stretch of black cotton road on the way to Handeni, we had better start. I pointed to the sky. â€˜Bad,â€™ Mâ€™Cola agreed. â€˜Go to the camp of Bâ€™wana Mâ€™Kubwa?â€™ â€˜Better.â€™ Then, vigorously, accepting the decision, â€˜Nâ€™Dio. Nâ€™Dio.â€™ â€˜We go,â€™ I said. Arrived at the thorn fence and the hut, we broke camp fast. There was a runner there from our last camp who had brought a note, written before P.O.M. and Pop had left, and bringing my mosquito net. There was nothing in the note, only good luck and that they were starting. I drank some water from one of our canvas bags, sat on a petrol tin and looked at the sky. I could not, conscientiously, chance staying. If it rained here we might not even be able to get out to the road. If it rained heavily on the road, we would never get out to the coast that season. Both the Austrian and Pop had said that, I had to go. That was settled, so there was no use to think how much I wanted to stay. The dayâ€™s fatigue helped make the decision easy. Everything was being loaded into the car and they were all gathering up their meat from the sticks around the ashes of the fire. â€˜Donâ€™t you want to eat, Bâ€™wana?â€™ Kamau asked me. â€˜No,â€™ I said. Then in English, â€˜Too bloody tired.â€™ â€˜Eat. You are hungry.â€™ â€˜Later, in the car.â€™ Mâ€™Cola went by with a load, his big, flat face completely blank again. It only came alive about hunting or some joke. I found a tin cup by the fire and called to him to bring the whisky, and the blank face cracked at the eyes and mouth into a smile as he took the flask out of his pocket. â€˜With water better,â€™ he said. â€˜You black Chinaman.â€™ They were all working fast and the Romanâ€™s women came over and stood a little way away watching the carrying and the packing of the car. There were two of them, good-looking, well built, and shy, but interested. The Roman was not back yet. I felt very badly to go off like this with no explanation to him. I liked the Roman very much and had a high regard for him. I took a drink of the whisky and water and looked at the two pairs of kudu horns that leaned against the wall of the chicken coop hut. From the white, cleanly picked skulls the horns rose in slow spirals that spreading made a turn, another turn, and then curved delicately into those smooth, ivory-like points. One pair was narrower and taller against the side of the hut. The other was almost as tall but wider in spread and heavier in beam. They were the colour of black walnut meats and they were beautiful to see. I went over and stood the Springfield against the hut between them and the tips reached past the muzzle of the rifle. As Kamau came back from carrying a load to the car I told him to bring the camera and then had him stand beside them while I took a picture. Then he picked them up, each head a load, and carried them over to the car. Garrick was talking loudly and in a roostery way to the Romanâ€™s women. As near as I could make out he was offering them the empty petrol boxes in exchange for a piece of something. â€˜Come here,â€™ I called to him. He came over still feeling smart. â€˜Listen,â€™ I told him in English. â€˜If I get through this safari without socking you itâ€™s going to be a bloody marvel. And if I ever hit you Iâ€™ll break your mucking jaw. Thatâ€™s all.â€™ He did not understand the words but the tone made it clearer than if I had got something out of the dictionary to tell him. I stood up and motioned to the women that they could have the petrol tins and the cases. I was damned if I could not have anything to do with them if I would let Garrick make any passes. â€˜Get in the car,â€™ I told him. â€˜No,â€™ as he started to make delivery of one of the petrol tins, â€˜in the car.â€™ He went over to the car. We were all packed now and ready to go. The horns were curling out the back of the car, tied on to the loads. I left some money for the Roman and one of the kudu hides with the boy. Then we got in the car. I got in the front seat with the Wanderobo-Masai. Behind were Mâ€™Cola, Garrick, and the runner, who was a man from the old manâ€™s village by the road. The old man was crouched on top of the loads at the back, close under the roof. We waved and started, passing more of the Romanâ€™s household, the older and uglier part, roasting up piles of meat by a log fire beside the trail that came up from the river through the maize field. We made the crossing all right, the creek was down and the banks had dried and I looked back at the field, the Romanâ€™s huts, and the stockade where we had camped, and the blue hills, dark under the heavy sky, and I felt very badly not to have seen the Roman and explain why we had gone off like this. Then we were going through the woods, following our trail and trying to make time to get out before dark. We had trouble, twice, at boggy places and Garrick seemed to be in a state of great hysteria, ordering people about when we were cutting brush and shovelling, until I was certain I would have to hit him. He called for corporal punishment the way a showing-off child does for a spanking. Kamau and Mâ€™Cola were both laughing at him. He was playing the victorious leader home from the chase now. I thought it was really a shame that he could not have his ostrich plumes. Once when we were stuck and I was shovelling and he was stooping over in a frenzy of advice and command-giving, I brought the handle of the shovel, with manifest un-intention, up hard into his belly and he sat down, backwards. I never looked toward him, and Mâ€™Cola, Kamau, and I could not look at each other for fear we would laugh. â€˜I am hurt,â€™ he said in astonishment, getting to his feet. â€˜Never get near a man shovelling,â€™ I said in English. â€˜Damned dangerous.â€™ â€˜I am hurt,â€™ said Garrick holding his belly. â€˜Rub it,â€™ I told him and rubbed mine to show him how. We all got into the car again and I began to feel sorry for the poor, bloody, useless, theatrical bastard, so I told Mâ€™Cola I would drink a bottle of beer. He got one out from under the loads in the back, we were going through the deer-park-looking country now, opened it, and I drank it slowly. I looked around and saw Garrick was all right now, letting his mouth run freely again. He rubbed his belly and seemed to be telling them what a hell of a man he was and how he had never felt it. I could feel the old man watching me from up under the roof as I drank the beer. â€˜Old man,â€™ I said. â€˜Yes, Bâ€™wana.â€™ â€˜A present,â€™ and I handed what was left in the bottle back. There wasnâ€™t much left but the foam and a very little beer. â€˜Beer?â€™ asked Mâ€™Cola. â€˜By God, yes,â€™ I said. I was thinking about beer and in my mind was back to that year in the spring when we walked on the mountain road to the Bains de Alliez and the beer-drinking contest where we failed to win the calf and came home that night around the mountain with the moonlight on the fields of narcissi that grew on the meadows, and how we were drunk and talked about how you would describe that light on that paleness, and the brown beer sitting at the wood tables under the wistaria vine at Aigle when we came in across the Rhone Valley from fishing the Stockalper with the horse chestnut trees in bloom, and Chink and I again discussing writing and whether you could call them waxen candelabras. God, what bloody literary discussions we had; we were literary as hell then just after the war, and later there was the good beer at Lippâ€™s at midnight after Mascart-Ledoux at the Cirque de Paris or Routis-Ledoux, or after any other great fight where you lost your voice and were still too excited to turn in; but beer was mostly those years just after the war with Chink and in the mountains. Flags for the Fusilier, crags for the Mountaineer, for English poets beer, strong beer for me. That was Chink then, quoting Robert Graves, then. We outgrew some countries and we went to others but beer was still a bloody marvel. The old man knew it too. I had seen it in his eye the first time he saw me take a drink. â€˜Beer,â€™ said Mâ€™Cola. He had it open, and I looked out at that park-like country, the engine hot under my boots, the Wanderobo-Masai as strong as ever beside me, Kamau watching the grooves of the tyre tracks in the green turf, and I hung my booted legs over the side to let my feet cool and drank the beer and wished old Chink was along. Captain Eric Edward Dorman-Smith, M.C., of His Majestyâ€™s Fifth Fusiliers. Now if he were here we could discuss how to describe this deer-park country and whether deer-park was enough to call it. Pop and Chink were much alike. Pop was older and more tolerant for his years and the same sort of company. I was learning under Pop, while Chink and I had discovered a big part of the world together and then our ways had gone a long way apart. But that damned sable bull. I should have killed him; but it was a running shot. To hit him at all I had to use him all as a target. Yes, you bastard, but what about the cow you missed twice, prone, standing broadside? Was that a running shot? No. If Iâ€™d gone to bed last night I would not have done that. Or if Iâ€™d wiped out the bore to get the oil out she would not have thrown high the first time. Then I would not have pulled down and shot under her the second shot. Every damned thing is your own fault if youâ€™re any good. I thought I could shoot a shot-gun better than I could and I had lost plenty of money backing my opinion, but I knew, coldly, and outside myself, that I could shoot a rifle on game as well as any son of a bitch that ever lived. Like hell I could. So what? So I gut-shot a sable bull and let him get away. Could I shoot as well as I thought I could? Sure. Then why did I miss on that cow? Hell, everybody is off sometime. Youâ€™ve got no bloody business to be off. Who the hell are you? My conscience? Listen, Iâ€™m all right with my conscience. I know just what kind of a son of a bitch I am and I know what I can do well. If I hadnâ€™t had to leave and pull out I would have got a sable bull. You know the Roman was a hunter. There was another herd. Why did I have to make a one-night stand? Was that any way to hunt? Hell, no. Iâ€™d make some money some way and when we came back we would come to the old manâ€™s village in lorries, then pack in with porters so there wouldnâ€™t be any damned car to worry about, send the porters back, and make a camp in the timber up the stream above the Romanâ€™s and hunt that country slowly, living there and hunting out each day, sometimes laying off and writing for a week, or writing half the day, or every other day, and get to know it as I knew the country around the lake where we were brought up. Iâ€™d see the buffalo feeding where they lived, and when the elephants came through the hills we would see them and watch them breaking branches and not have to shoot, and I would lie in the fallen leaves and watch the kudu feed out and never fire a shot unless I saw a better head than this one in the back, and instead of trailing that sable bull, gut-shot to hell, all day, Iâ€™d lie behind a rock and watch them on the hillside and see them long enough so they belonged to me for ever. Sure, if Garrick didnâ€™t take his Bâ€™wana Simba car in there and shoot the country out. But if he did Iâ€™d go on down beyond those hills and there would be another country where a man could live and hunt if he had time to live and hunt. Theyâ€™d gone in wherever a car could go. But there must be pockets like this all over, that no one knows of, that the cars pass all along the road. They all hunt the same places. â€˜Beer?â€™ asked Mâ€™Cola. â€˜Yes,â€™ I said. Sure, you couldnâ€™t make a living. Everyone had explained that. The locusts came and ate your crops and the monsoon failed, and the rains did not come, and everything dried up and died. There were ticks and fly to kill the stock, and the mosquitoes gave you fever and maybe you got blackwater. Your cattle would die and you would get no price for your coffee. It took an Indian to make money from sisal and on the coast every coconut plantation meant a man ruined by the idea of making money from copra. A white hunter worked three months out of the year and drank for twelve and the Government was ruining the country for the benefit of the Hindu and the natives. That was what they told you. Sure. But I did not want to make money. All I wanted was to live in it and have time to hunt. Already I had had one of the diseases and had experienced the necessity of washing a three-inch bit of my large intestine with soap and water and tucking it back where it belonged an unnumbered amount of times a day. There were remedies which cured this and it was well worth going through for what I had seen and where I had been. Besides I caught that on the dirty boat out from Marseilles. P.O.M. hadnâ€™t been ill a day. Neither had Karl. I loved this country and I felt at home and where a man feels at home, outside of where heâ€™s born, is where heâ€™s meant to go. Then, in my grandfatherâ€™s time, Michigan was a malaria ridden state. They called it fever and ague. And in Tortugas, where Iâ€™d spent months, a thousand men once died of yellow fever. New continents and islands try to frighten you with disease as a snake hisses. The snake may be poisonous too. You kill them off. Hell, what I had a month ago would have killed me in the old days before they invented the remedies. Maybe it would and maybe I would have got well. It is easier to keep well in a good country by taking simple precautions than to pretend that a country which is finished is still good. A continent ages quickly once we come. The natives live in harmony with it. But the foreigner destroys, cuts down the trees, drains the water, so that the water supply is altered, and in a short time the soil, once the sod is turned under, is cropped out, and next it starts to blow away as it has blown away in every old country and as I had seen it start to blow in Canada. The earth gets tired of being exploited. A country wears out quickly unless man puts back in it all his residue and that of all his beasts. When he quits using beasts and uses machines the earth defeats him quickly. The machine canâ€™t reproduce, nor does it fertilize the soil, and it eats what he cannot raise. A country was made to be as we found it. We are the intruders and after we are dead we may have ruined it but it will still be there and we donâ€™t know what the next changes are. I suppose they all end up like Mongolia. I would come back to Africa but not to make a living from it. I could do that with two pencils and a few hundred sheets of the cheapest paper. But I would come back to where it pleased me to live; to really live. Not just to let my life pass. Our people went to America because that was the place to go then. It had been a good country and we had made a mess of it and I would go, now, somewhere else as we had always had the right to go somewhere else and as we had always gone. You could always come back. Let the others come to America who did not know that they had come too late. Our people had seen it at its best and fought for it when it was well worth fighting for. Now I would go somewhere else. We always went in the old days and there were still good places to go. I knew a good country when I saw one. Here there was game, plenty of birds, and I liked the natives. Here I could shoot and fish. That, and writing, and reading, and seeing pictures was all I cared about doing. And I could remember all the pictures. Other things I liked to watch but they were what I liked to do. That and ski-ing. But my legs were bad now and it was not worth the time you spent hunting good snow any more. You saw too many people ski-ing now. Now, the car making a turn around a bank and crossing a green, grassy field, we came in sight of the Masai village. When the Masai saw us they started running and we stopped, surrounded by them, just below the stockade. There were the young warriors who had run with us, and now their women and the children all came out to see us. The children were all quite young and the men and women all seemed the same age. There were no old people. They all seemed to be our great friends and we gave a very successful party with refreshments in the shape of our bread which they all ate with much laughing, the men first, then the women. Then I had Mâ€™Cola open the two cans of mincemeat and the plum pudding and I cut these into rations and passed them out. I had heard and read that the Masai subsisted only on the blood of their cattle mixed with milk, drawing the blood off from a wound in a vein of the neck made by shooting an arrow at close range. These Masai, however, ate bread, cold mincemeat, and plum pudding with great relish and much laughter and joking. One very tall and handsome one kept asking me something that I did not understand and then five or six more joined in. Whatever this was they wanted it very badly. Finally the tallest one made a very strange face and emitted a sound like a dying pig. I understood finally: he was asking if we had one of those, and I pressed the button of the klaxon. The children ran screaming, the warriors laughed and laughed, and then as Kamau, in response to popular demand, pressed the klaxon again and again, I watched the look of utter rapture and ecstasy on the womenâ€™s faces and knew that with that klaxon he could have had any woman in the tribe. Finally we had to go and after distributing the empty beer bottles, the labels from the bottles, and finally the bottle caps, picked up by Mâ€™Cola from the floor, we left, klaxoning the women into ecstasy, the children into panic, and the warriors into delight. The warriors ran with us for a good way but we had to make time, the going was good through the park-like country and, in a little while, we waved to the last of them standing straight and tall, in their brown skin garments, their clubbed pig-tails hanging, their faces stained a red-brown, leaning on their spears, looking after us and smiling. The sun was almost down and as I did not know the road I had the runner get up in front to sit with the Wanderobo-Masai and help direct Kamau and I sat in the back with Mâ€™Cola and Garrick. We were out of the park country and on to the dry bush-spattered plain before the sun went down and I had another bottle of the German beer and, watching the country, saw, suddenly, that all the trees were full of white storks. I did not know whether they were there in migration or were following the locusts but, in the twilight, they were lovely to see and, deeply moved by them, I gave the old man a good two fingers of beer that was left in the bottom of the bottle. On the next bottle I forgot and drank it all before I remembered the old man. (There were still storks in the trees and we saw some Grantâ€™s gazelles feeding off to the right. A jackal, like a grey fox, trotted across the road.) So I told Mâ€™Cola to open another bottle and we were through the plain and climbing the long slope toward the road and the village, the two mountains in sight now, and it almost dark and quite cold when I handed the bottle to the old man, who took it where he was crouched up under the roof, and nursed it tenderly. At the village we stopped in the road in the dark, and I paid the runner the amount it said to give him in the note he had brought. I paid the old man the amount Pop said to pay him and a bonus. Then there was a big dispute among them all. Garrick was to go to the main camp to get his money. Abdullah insisted upon going along. He did not trust Garrick. The Wanderobo-Masai insisted pitifully that he go. He was sure the others would cheat him out of his share and I was fairly sure they would, too. There was petrol that had been left for us to use in case we were short and for us to bring in any event. We were overloaded and I did not know how the road was ahead. But I thought we might carry Abdullah and Garrick and squeeze in the Wanderobo-Masai. There was no question of the old man going. He had been paid off and had agreed to the amount, but now he would not leave the car. He crouched on top of the load and hung on to the ropes saying, â€˜I am going with Bâ€™wanaâ€™. Mâ€™Cola and Kamau had to break his handholds and pull him off to re-load, him shouting, â€˜I want to go with Bâ€™wana!â€™ While they were loading in the dark he held on to my arm and talked very quietly in a language that I could not understand. â€˜You have the shillings,â€™ I said. â€˜Yes, Bâ€™wana,â€™ he said. That was not what it was about. The money was all right. Then, when we started to get in the car he broke away and started to climb up through the back and on to the loads. Garrick and Abdullah pulled him down. â€˜You canâ€™t go. There isnâ€™t room.â€™ He talked to me softly again, begging and pleading. â€˜No, there is no room.â€™ I remembered I had a small penknife and I got it out of my pocket and put it in his hand. He pushed it back in my hand. â€˜No,â€™ he said. â€˜No.â€™ He was quiet then and stood by the road. But when we started, he started to run after the car and I could hear him in the dark screaming, â€˜Bâ€™wana! I want to go with Bâ€™wana!â€™ We went on up the road, the headlights making it seem like a boulevard after where we had been. We drove fifty-five miles on that road in the dark night without incident. I stayed awake until after we were through the bad part, a long plain of deeply rutted black cotton where the headlights picked out the trail through bushes and then, when the road was better, I went to sleep, waking occasionally to see the headlights shining on a wall of tall trees, or a naked bank, or when we ground in low gear up a steep place, the light slanting up ahead. Finally, when the speedometer showed fifty miles, we stopped and woke a native in his hut and Mâ€™Cola asked about the camp. I slept again and then woke as we were turning off the road and on a track through trees with the fires of the camp showing ahead. Then as we came to where our lights shone on the green tents I shouted and we all commenced to shout and blew the klaxon and I let the gun off, the flame cutting up into the dark and it making a great noise. Then we were stopped and out from Popâ€™s tent I saw him coming, thick and heavy in his dressing-gown, and then he had his arms around my shoulders and said, â€˜You god damned bull fighterâ€™, and I was clapping him on the back. And I said, â€˜Look at them, Popâ€™. â€˜I saw them,â€™ he said. â€˜The whole back of the carâ€™s full of them.â€™ Then I was holding P.O.M. tight, she feeling very small inside the quilted bigness of the dressing-gown, and we were saying things to each other. Then Karl came out and I said, â€˜Hi, Karlâ€™. â€˜Iâ€™m so damned glad,â€™ he said. â€˜Theyâ€™re marvellous.â€™ Mâ€™Cola had the horns down by now and he and Kamau were holding them so they could all see them in the light of the fire. â€˜What did you get?â€™ I asked Karl. â€˜Just another one of those. What do you call them? Tendalla.â€™ â€˜Swell,â€™ I said. I knew I had one no one could beat and I hoped he had a good one too. â€˜How big was he?â€™ â€˜Oh, fifty-seven,â€™ Karl said. â€˜Letâ€™s see him,â€™ I said, cold in the pit of my stomach. â€˜Heâ€™s over there,â€™ Pop said, and we went over. They were the biggest, widest, darkest, longest-curling, heaviest, most unbelievable pair of kudu horns in the world. Suddenly, poisoned with envy, I did not want to see mine again; never, never. â€˜Thatâ€™s great,â€™ I said, the words coming out as cheerfully as a croak. I tried it again. â€˜Thatâ€™s swell. How did you get him?â€™ â€˜There were three,â€™ Karl said. â€˜They were all as big as that. I couldnâ€™t tell which was the biggest. We had a hell of a time. I hit him four or five times.â€™ â€˜Heâ€™s a wonder,â€™ I said. I was getting so I could do it a little better but it would not fool anybody yet. â€˜Iâ€™m awfully glad you got yours,â€™ Karl said. â€˜Theyâ€™re beauties. I want to hear all about them in the morning. I know youâ€™re tired to-night. Good night.â€™ He went off, delicate as always, so we could talk about it if we wanted to. â€˜Come on over and have a drink,â€™ I called. â€˜No thanks, I think I better go to bed. Iâ€™ve got a sort of headache.â€™ â€˜Good night, Karl.â€™ â€˜Good night. Good night, Poor Old Mamma,â€™ â€˜Good night,â€™ we all said. By the fire, with whisky and soda, we talked and I told them about it all. â€˜Perhaps theyâ€™ll find the bull,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Weâ€™ll offer a reward for the horns. Have them sent to the Game Department. How big is your biggest one?â€™ â€˜Fifty-two.â€™ â€˜Over the curve?â€™ â€˜Yes. Maybe heâ€™s a little better.â€™ â€˜Inches donâ€™t mean anything,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Theyâ€™re damned wonderful kudu.â€™ â€˜Sure. But why does he have to beat me so bloody badly?â€™ â€˜Heâ€™s got the luck,â€™ Pop said. â€˜God, what a kudu. Iâ€™ve only seen one head killed over fifty in my life before. That was up on Kalal.â€™ â€˜We knew he had it when we left the other camp. The lorry came in and told us,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Iâ€™ve spent all my time praying for you. Ask Mr. J. P.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™ll never know what it meant to see that car come into the firelight with those damned horns sticking out,â€™ Pop said. â€˜You old bastard.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s wonderful,â€™ P.O.M. said. â€˜Letâ€™s go and look at them again.â€™ â€˜You can always remember how you shot them. Thatâ€™s what you really get out of it,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Theyâ€™re damned wonderful kudu.â€™ But I was bitter and I was bitter all night long. In the morning, though, it was gone. It was all gone and I have never had it again. Pop and I were up and looking at the heads before breakfast. It was a grey, overcast morning and cold. The rains were coming. â€˜Theyâ€™re three marvellous kudu,â€™ he said. â€˜They look all right with the big one this morning,â€™ I said. They did, too, strangely enough. I had accepted the big one now and was happy to see him and that Karl had him. When you put them side by side they looked all right. They really did. They all were big. â€˜Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re feeling better,â€™ Pop said. â€˜Iâ€™m feeling better myself.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m really glad he has him,â€™ I said truly. â€˜Mineâ€™ll hold me.â€™ â€˜We have very primitive emotions,â€™ he said. â€˜Itâ€™s impossible not to be competitive. Spoils everything, though.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m all through with that,â€™ I said. â€˜Iâ€™m all right again. I had quite a trip, you know.â€™ â€˜Did you not,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Pop, what does it mean when they shake hands and get hold of your thumb and pull it?â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s on the order of blood brotherhood but a little less formal. Whoâ€™s been doing that to you?â€™ â€˜Everybody but Kamau.â€™ â€˜Youâ€™re getting to be a hell of a fellow,â€™ Pop said. â€˜You must be an old timer out here. Tell me, are you much of a tracker and bird shot?â€™ â€˜Go to hell.â€™ â€˜Mâ€™Cola has been doing that with you too?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜Well, well,â€™ said Pop. â€˜Letâ€™s get the little Memsahib and have some breakfast. Not that Iâ€™m feeling up to it.â€™ â€˜I am,â€™ I said. â€˜I havenâ€™t eaten anything since day before yesterday.â€™ â€˜Drank some beer though, didnâ€™t you?â€™ â€˜Ah, yes.â€™ â€˜Beerâ€™s a food,â€™ Pop said. We got the little Memsahib and old Karl and had a very jolly breakfast.
