# Document-Classifier

This project was for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.

The program uses a training set of text files about politics and religion in order to count which words appear most fequently.
It then prints out the words in decreasing order. 
Finally, it uses that data to classify text files as either being about politics or religion.
